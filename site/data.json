      "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has the potential to enable the prediction of gene mutations directly from routine histopathology slides in lung cancer. However, existing approaches have largely been limited to mutation-level prediction and have not achieved precise identification of driver mutation subtypes or exonic variants, constraining the translation of DL into targeted therapy. In this study, we assembled a large multicenter dataset of paired pathology images and next-generation sequencing from 2573 lung cancer patients from four hospitals in China. Development of NAVF-Bio, an adaptive multi-view feature fusion framework based on multiple-instance learning, enabled integration of tumor microenvironment (TME) features from whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict driver mutations and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Benchmarking against 11 state-of-the-art DL methods indicated that NAVF-Bio consistently outperformed existing models in predicting driver mutations (TP53, EGFR, KRAS, ALK) and TMB status, achieving clinically relevant performance in external multicenter validation. Notably, NAVF-Bio accurately predicted the mutated driver gene exons across centers, while interpretability analyses using WSI visualization and TME quantification further demonstrated the ability of NAVF-Bio to elucidate pathologically relevant tumor features. Finally, a multi-gene mutation prediction platform for lung cancer was generated to facilitate the screening of driver gene mutations. Overall, NAVF-Bio mimics the workflow of pathologists when examining slides by observing multi-scale features of WSIs and TME characteristics to predict driver gene mutations in lung cancer, which could guide the selection of targeted therapies for patients."

      "abstract": "Dysregulated ISC metabolism has been implicated in cancer progression, but its role in LUAD pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that ISC biogenesis is significantly upregulated in LUAD, driven by transcription factors KLF15 and ZNF384, which activate GLRX5, LYRM4, NFS1 and BOLA3 promoters. IL-1β promotes PCAF mitochondrial translocation, releasing EP300 to amplify KLF15/ZNF384-mediated transcriptional activation. The natural monoterpenoid Hinokitiol inhibits LUAD growth by disrupting EP300-KLF15/ZNF384 interactions, suppressing ISC biogenesis gene expression and inducing ferroptosis. Mechanistically, the membrane protein TMDD1, particularly its cytoplasmic domain, promotes Hinokitiol's anti-tumor effects by facilitating EP300-KLF15/ZNF384 dissociation and inhibiting ISC biogenesis. Remarkably, Hinokitiol exhibits stage-dependent efficacy, with superior suppression of metastatic (stage IV) tumors linked to heightened ferroptosis sensitivity. This study not only elucidates the transcriptional machinery governing ISC biogenesis in LUAD but also highlights Hinokitiol's dual mechanism as a promising stage-specific therapeutic agent, offering novel strategies for advanced disease management."

      "abstract": "The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer (LC) screening trial (Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek [NELSON]) demonstrated low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduces LC mortality by 24% among men. The NELSON protocol differed from previous trials in the eligibility criteria, the use of volume-based nodule management, and increasing screening intervals. The early-stage sensitivity of the protocol is pivotal in determining the optimal screening strategy, such as the interval and age range. The MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis-Lung natural history model was used to reproduce LC incidence and mortality by detection method (clinical or screen-detected), sex, histology, and stage in the NELSON trial based on individual-level data. We evaluated screening effectiveness by stage and histology, accounting for population characteristics, trial design, and LC epidemiology. We find stage IA non-small cell LC (NSCLC) sensitivity of 24.6% (other NSCLC) to 41.0% (adenocarcinoma) at baseline screening. At repeat screening rounds, we find this increased to 70.9% for stage IA adenocarcinoma. For stage IB, the sensitivity by histology ranges from 26.4% to 77.1%; for stage II, 39.6%-81.9%. Upon detection, the probability of LC mortality prevention is estimated at 83% for stage IA. The sensitivity for detecting early-stage LC is found to depend on the histology of cancer and is increased for adenocarcinoma at repeat screenings. Despite a low rate of referral to follow-up screening in the NELSON trial, early-stage CT sensitivity and the probability of mortality prevention were similar to previous estimates from the National Lung cancer Screening Trial. Previously demonstrated screening effectiveness may be maintained when implementing new programs, while reducing unnecessary follow-up when considering NELSON evidence."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate whether pretreatment circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a predictive biomarker for recurrence in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC), including those with pathologically unproven (PU) who received ablative radiotherapy.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients clinically diagnosed with cT1-2N0M0 NSCLC treated with radiotherapy alone at a single institute were included. Pretreatment plasma and matched white blood cell samples were subjected to targeted sequencing to detect ctDNA. The association between ctDNA detection and prognosis was evaluated. Integrated analysis including non-squamous cell carcinoma (SQ) cohort and enhancement of recurrence prediction with radiographic features were also evaluated.\n\nRESULTS: Of the 19 patients (10 SQ, and 9 PU) who met the sequence quality criteria, ctDNA was detected in 6. At the median follow-up of 60 months, detectable ctDNA was significantly associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) in both the SQ and PU cohorts (P = .01 and .02). In an analysis of 62 patients combined with the non-SQ cohort, ctDNA detection was the only significant factor for PFS. The combination of ctDNA and a high positron emission tomography maximum standardized uptake value provided a better recurrence risk model than ctDNA alone (the C-index improved from 0.63 to 0.72).\n\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that pretreatment ctDNA detection can predict recurrence in patients with cT1-2N0M0 NSCLC, including those with PU tumors treated with ablative radiotherapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In treatment-naïve advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, approximately 10% to 15% correspond to uncommon mutations. For patients with EGFR uncommon mutations, monotherapy with either a second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), afatinib, or a third-generation EGFR-TKI, osimertinib, is recommended as the initial therapy. However, needs remain unmet for patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and those who do not respond adequately to single-agent TKI therapy for EGFR uncommon mutations. The recently published FLAURA2 trial showed that osimertinib in combination with platinum-pemetrexed significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and provided high disease control compared with osimertinib monotherapy for common mutations. Therefore, we planned this phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of osimertinib in combination with platinum-pemetrexed in treatment-naïve NSCLC patients with EGFR uncommon mutations.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients will be enrolled in the study. The primary endpoint is the objective response rate, and the secondary endpoints include safety, PFS and overall survival in overall patients, patients with and without CNS lesions at baseline and according to mutation subtype.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, we will explore the efficacy and safety of osimertinib in combination with platinum-pemetrexed in treatment-naïve NSCLC patients with EGFR uncommon mutations. Our findings may provide treatment options for patients with EGFR uncommon mutations, especially those with CNS metastases or those requiring more intensive treatment."

We report exploratory subgroup analyses from CASPIAN.\n\nMETHODS: Patients with untreated ES-SCLC were randomized to durvalumab plus EP or EP alone. We analyzed OS and safety in subgroups defined by age, sex, and planned platinum agent, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) by age.\n\nRESULTS: Of 537 patients (durvalumab plus EP: n = 268; EP alone: n = 269), 80.6% versus 19.4% were aged <70 versus ≥70 years; 69.6% versus 30.4% were male versus female; and planned platinum was cisplatin versus carboplatin in 25.1% versus 74.9%. The OS HRs for durvalumab plus EP versus EP were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.58-0.88) versus 0.74 (95% CI, 0.49-1.11) for patients aged <70 versus ≥70 years; 0.76 (95% CI, 0.62-0.95) versus 0.60 (95% CI, 0.42-0.84) for males versus females; and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.45-0.94) versus 0.74 (95% CI, 0.60-0.91) for planned cisplatin versus carboplatin. With durvalumab plus EP, rates of grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were similar across subgroups; serious AEs were more frequent in patients aged ≥70 versus <70 years; and immune-mediated AEs were more common in females versus males. Adding durvalumab to EP had no detrimental effect on PROs in either age subgroup.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of durvalumab plus EP as first-line standard of care for ES-SCLC. Additional trials focused on elderly populations would be informative."

Key secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. The present analysis includes patients enrolled at sites in Asia.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 43 patients were enrolled at sites in Asia. ORR was 46.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.7-62.6) and median DOR was 7.2 months (95% CI 3.9 to not estimable). The median follow-up was 16.6 months for PFS and 21.2 months for OS. Median PFS was 5.4 months (95% CI 3.0-8.1) and median OS was 19.0 months (95% CI 11.4 to not estimable). The most common treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) was cytokine release syndrome (48.8%), and all such events were grade 1 or 2. There were no discontinuations due to treatment-related AEs.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Tarlatamab demonstrated durable responses and promising survival outcomes with a manageable safety profile in this post hoc analysis of patients from Asia with previously treated SCLC.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05060016."

      "abstract": "Overexpression of EGFR and MET occurs in a high proportion of recurrent and/or metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Amivantamab, an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune-cell directing activity, is approved in EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer and is being evaluated in phase 3 trials for other solid tumors. Cohort 1 of OrigAMI-4 (NCT06385080) enrolled adult participants with human papillomavirus-unrelated R/M HNSCC with disease progression on/after prior checkpoint inhibitor and platinum-based chemotherapy. Subcutaneous amivantamab was administered at 1600 mg (2240 mg for ≥ 80 kg body weight) on Cycle 1 Day 1 and 2400 mg (3360 mg for ≥ 80 kg body weight) thereafter. Primary end point was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR). As of July 1, 2025 (median follow-up, 3.5 months [range, 0-13.4]), 86 participants (median age, 63.5 years; 45 % Asian; 43 % White) received ≥ 1 dose of subcutaneous amivantamab. Subcutaneous amivantamab was well tolerated. Administration-related reactions were reported in 7 % (n = 6/86) of participants; no new safety signals were observed. In the efficacy population (n = 38; median follow-up, 8.3 months [range, 1.1-13.4]), confirmed ORR was 45 % (95 % CI, 29 %-62 %), median time to first response was 6.4 weeks (range, 5.7-18.3), and median duration of response was 7.2 months (95 % CI, 5.3-NE). The clinical benefit rate (responder or durable stable disease) was 76 % (95 % CI, 60 %-89 %). Median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95 % CI, 4.2-9.0). Subcutaneous amivantamab as second-/third-line treatment among participants with R/M HNSCC demonstrated rapid and durable antitumor activity. The safety profile of subcutaneous amivantamab was consistent with previous studies."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Subcutaneous (SC) formulations of oncology therapies could provide time-saving benefits for both patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) compared with intravenous (IV) delivery. This prospective observational study, conducted alongside the MK-3475A-D77 phase 3, open-label randomized clinical trial, quantifies HCP and patient time with pembrolizumab SC versus pembrolizumab IV among patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nMETHODS: Seventeen sites across eight countries in Europe (n = 4), South America (n = 3), and Asia (n = 1) were enrolled. Primary endpoints were active HCP time; patient time in the treatment chair, treatment room, and healthcare facility; and consumables usage. Descriptive statistics included weighted mean (WM), and a linear mixed model (LMM) was employed to explore differences in time measures between pembrolizumab SC and pembrolizumab IV per visit.\n\nRESULTS: Overall, 212 observations were analyzed (153 SC and 59 IV). Total active HCP time was reduced by 45.6% with SC versus IV (WM, 14.0 vs 25.8 min); HCPs spent 44.3% less time on the drug preparation process with SC versus IV (WM, 5.1 vs 9.1 min) and 46.3% less time on the drug administration process with SC versus IV (WM, 8.9 vs 16.7 min). Patient chair time was reduced by 49.6% with SC versus IV (WM, 59.0 vs 117.2 min). Patients receiving SC spent less time in the treatment room than those receiving IV (WM, 66.7 vs 126.9 min; difference - 47.4%). Exploratory LMM showed considerable between-group differences for active HCP time and patient time in the treatment chair and treatment room.\n\nCONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab SC substantially reduces active HCP time and patient chair time versus pembrolizumab IV. Time liberated for HCPs could be reallocated toward additional patient care activities, while optimized chair utilization could improve overall healthcare efficiency."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major adverse prognostic factor with heterogeneous outcomes across tumor types. We aimed to describe the characteristics of lung cancer patients with VTE, compare outcomes across malignancies, and assess their association with complications, progression, and survival.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed TESEO-SEOM, a prospective multicenter registry including patients with active cancer and VTE. Patients were stratified by tumor site, with lung as reference. Outcomes included recurrent VTE, bleeding, and survival. Analyses were stratified by tumor type and VTE presentation (clinically suspected, symptomatic/asymptomatic incidental). Complications were estimated using competing-risk methods.\n\nRESULTS: Among 3855 patients, the most frequent cancers were gastrointestinal (39.4 %), lung (22.2 %), and breast (10.4 %). Pulmonary embolism predominated (55 %), especially in lung cancer (69.8 %). Overall, 48.9 % of events were clinically suspected and 50.9 % incidental; suspected were more common in lung cancer (53.9 %), whereas incidental diagnoses predominated in gastrointestinal tumors (58.8 %). Complications occurred in 17.6 % (10.2 % bleeding, 7.4 % recurrent VTE). Recurrence was highest in gastrointestinal cancers (11.4 %, Gray's p = 0.022), while bleeding did not differ (p = 0.213). VTE-related mortality was low (1 %), while mixed-cause mortality was highest in lung cancer (17.2 %). Median PFS and OS were shortest in lung cancer (4.5 and 7.7 months, p < 0.0001). Incidental asymptomatic events conferred longer survival, particularly in lung cancer (OS 11.5 vs. 7.3 months for symptomatic incidental and 5.6 for suspected, p < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION: VTE in lung cancer is associated with more severe presentation, higher mixed-cause mortality, and worse survival than in other tumors. Incidental asymptomatic VTE predicts better outcomes, supporting risk stratification by tumor type and presentation."

During a median follow-up of 41.0 months (range 23.8-64.3), we reported 938 deaths. The optimal stratification method was used to determine the gender-specific optimal threshold for FFMI. Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier curve were used to evaluate the relationship between FFMI and prognosis. Mediation analysis was used to determine the mediating effect of inflammation.\n\nRESULTS: The optimal cutoff points for low FFMI in males and females were 17.27 kg/m\n\nCONCLUSION: In this prospective study, low FFMI, as determined by cutoff values, was an independent prognostic factor for patients with LC in both males and females.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate staging of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential to determine further management. Current guidelines recommend confirmatory mediastinoscopy for patients with suspicious mediastinal lymph node metastases in image-based staging but negative findings on endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). In clinical practice, adherence to these recommendations is low and many physicians omit invasive surgical staging. This study aimed to assess the results of subsequent video-assisted mediastinoscopic lymphadenectomy (VAMLA).\n\nMETHODS: Retrospective single-center cohort analysis of patients who underwent surgery between 2015 and 2019. All patients were diagnosed with potentially resectable lung cancer or FDG-avid pulmonary nodule suspicious for NSCLC and underwent VAMLA following N0-N2 EBUS-TBNA for mediastinal staging.\n\nRESULTS: VAMLA was performed in 228 patients. Nodal upstaging after EBUS-TBNA occurred in 17.5 % of the cases (n = 40). During EBUS-TBNA, 1.72 (±1.06) lymph node stations were sampled, compared to 5.59 (±1.1) resected stations in VAMLA (p < 0.001). Clinical nodal status staged by PET/CT was significantly correlated with the occurrence of nodal upstaging by VAMLA, with an odds ratio of 7.69 in cN2 and 5.88 in patients with cN3, compared to cN0. Complications occurred in 8 patients (3.59 %). VAMLA was false negative in 1 patient (0.4 %).\n\nCONCLUSION: Subsequent VAMLA enables the accurate staging of patients after negative EBUS-TBNA. Overall, 17.5 % of cases had nodal upstaging and would otherwise not have received guideline-compliant treatment for NSCLC. These results underline the role of surgical mediastinal staging after negative EBUS-TBNA in patients with suspicious radiologic findings."

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors for VTE in patients with lung cancer using the CS-Lung003 platform, a multicenter prospective observational study of advanced lung cancer.\n\nMETHODS: Patients with a pathologic diagnosis of lung cancer at any stage were included. The incidence of VTE was calculated using the CS-Lung003 database, and risk factors were examined using logistic regression analysis.\n\nRESULTS: The analysis included 1744 patients (80 % male). Sixty patients (3.4 %) had VTE at/after enrollment in the CS-Lung003 trial. The median age was 69 years (range 63-76) in the group without VTE and 72 years (range 67-77) in the group with VTE. Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 58.7 % of patients in the group without VTE and 46.7 % in the group with VTE. Univariate analysis revealed male sex, body weight, and hypertension as risk factors for VTE. Overall survival was 29.1 months in the group without VTE and 30.6 months in the group with VTE. Among patients with stage IIIB-IV, the VTE group showed significantly longer overall survival compared with the non-VTE group (p = 0.041).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VTE in this study was low, suggesting that there may have been patients with VTE complications that were not reported in the registry. In addition, most patients with VTE received therapeutic intervention; appropriate diagnosis and treatment may have allowed cancer treatment to continue. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of VTE might allow lung cancer therapy continuation without compromising survival.\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY/REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN-CTR/UMIN000026696."

      "abstract": "Tumor cell-vasculature interactions play a crucial role in lung cancer progression and metastasis; however, traditional cell culture models rarely capture these complex dynamics. We developed a vascularized lung cancer organoid (VLCO) model by coculturing lung cancer organoids (LCOs) with blood vessel organoids (BVOs) to recreate the tumor-vasculature niche in a three-dimensional in vitro system. During coculture, LCOs migrated along BVO-formed vascular networks and invaded vessel-like structures, mimicking intravasation. The organoid types interacted via secretory factors, including TGF-β and PDGF-BB, inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in LCOs and pericyte-to-fibroblast transition in BVOs. We also developed a scalable drug response assay for vasculature-induced EMT, enabling targeted therapeutic screening. The VLCO model provides a robust platform for studying tumor-endothelial crosstalk and testing antimetastatic therapies targeting tumor-vasculature interactions."

Alectinib is a second-generation ALK inhibitor, and is generally considered a safer option during pregnancy compared to lorlatinib. Here, we describe a case of a patient who became pregnant whilst on alectinib complicated by rapid disease progression, with a focus on maternal-fetal outcomes and placental health.\n\nMETHODS: A brief report was conducted detailing clinical management by a multidisciplinary team, pharmacokinetic analysis of alectinib levels, and post-delivery placental examination, including histopathology and mitochondrial respirometry function assessment as an indicator of placental health.\n\nRESULTS: A 29 year-old woman with metastatic ALK-rearranged NSCLC, became pregnant whilst on alectinib therapy. At 24 weeks of gestation, she experienced rapid systemic disease progression manifesting as marantic endocarditis with multi-territory small cerebral infarcts, thrombocytopaenia, an elevated D-dimer and developed two large middle cerebral ischaemic strokes requiring endovascular clot retrieval. Carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy was added to alectinib. The patient responded well to treatment and successfully delivered an infant via elective caesarean section at 34+5 weeks. The patient was switched to lorlatinib plus pemetrexed postpartum. Although she achieved a complete metabolic response with lorlatinib plus pemetrexed, disease progression occurred several months later, and she died 28 months after initial diagnosis. Placental analysis showed features indicative of fetal growth restriction (FGR). Mitochondrial function appeared within normal limits, despite changes in placental morphology. The infant has shown normal development at 9 months of age.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of concurrent alectinib and cytotoxic chemotherapy during pregnancy, successfully used in the setting of progressive ALK-rearranged NSCLC. The placental findings align with observations in pregnancies complicated by FGR. This case highlights the potential feasibility and safety of intensification of systemic therapy during pregnancy, and underscores the importance of individualised multi-disciplinary care."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Immunotherapy targeting PD-L1 improves outcomes in patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no progression after definitive, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT). Earlier administration of immunotherapy, simultaneously with cCRT, may improve outcomes further.\n\nMETHODS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either durvalumab or placebo administered from the start of cCRT. Patients without progression after completing cCRT received consolidation durvalumab or placebo (per initial random assignment) until progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review. Key secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), the proportion of patients alive at 24 months (OS24), and safety.\n\nRESULTS: In total, 328 patients were randomly assigned to receive durvalumab (n = 219) or placebo (n = 109). There was no statistically significant difference with durvalumab versus placebo in PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.12];\n\nCONCLUSION: Among patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, durvalumab administered from the start of cCRT failed to demonstrate additional benefit compared with cCRT plus placebo. Consolidation durvalumab following definitive cCRT remains the standard of care in this setting."
