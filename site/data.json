      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have dramatically improved outcomes for patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but relapse frequently occurs because of drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells that can evolve and develop diverse mechanisms of drug resistance. In samples from patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting, we observed enriched expression of the cell surface protein TROP2, a target of clinically active antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). We confirmed these findings across multiple EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell line and patient-derived xenograft models treated with osimertinib in vivo. Treatment with the TROP2 ADC sacituzumab govitecan at the time of osimertinib-induced minimal residual disease only modestly delayed tumor recurrence in vivo, whereas a single infusion of sacituzumab-based TROP2-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells significantly prolonged relapse-free survival, with evidence of cure. These data highlight the potential of engineering TROP2 CAR T-cell therapy to eliminate EGFR DTPs in patients.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: We provide a rationale for targeting TROP2 in EGFR-mutated NSCLC DTPs. In contrast to TROP2 ADC therapy, targeting of TROP2 with CAR-T cells can eliminate osimertinib-induced DTPs in vivo, revealing the promise of developing novel TROP2-based CAR-T cells to promote durable response and prevent disease relapse in patients."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Acquisition of resistance to anticancer therapies is a multistep process initiated by the survival of drug-tolerant persister cells. Accessibility of drug-tolerant persister cells in patients is limited, which has hindered understanding the mechanisms driving their emergence. In this study, using multiple patient-derived models to isolate persister cells, we showed that these cells are transcriptionally plastic in vivo and return to a common treatment naïve-like state upon relapse, regardless of treatment. Hallmarks of the persister state in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) across treatment modalities included high expression of basal keratins together with activation of stress response and inflammation pathways. These hallmarks were also activated in HER2+ breast and lung cancer cells in response to targeted therapies. Analysis of gene regulatory networks identified AP-1, NF-κB, and IRF/STAT as the key drivers of this hallmark persister state. Functionally, FOSL1, an AP-1 member, drove cells to the persister state by binding enhancers and reprogramming the transcriptome of cancer cells. On the contrary, cancer cells without FOSL1 had a decreased ability to reach the persister state. By defining hallmarks of TNBC persistence on multiple therapies, this study provides a resource to design effective combination therapeutic strategies that limit resistance.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: Elucidation of the features of the drug-tolerant persister state in triple-negative breast cancer reveals shared programs across patients and treatments that offer opportunities to prevent persistence and delay tumor recurrence."

      "abstract": "EGFR mutations are common oncogenic drivers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and around one-third of patients develop brain metastases over the course of their disease. Patients with non-classical EGFR mutations, such as insertions in exon 20, are a high unmet need with a worse prognosis compared to patients with classical EGFR mutations. Here, we describe the discovery and development of enozertinib (formerly ORIC-114), a highly brain-penetrant, orally bioavailable, irreversible inhibitor that targets EGFR exon 20 mutations with unparalleled kinome selectivity. Preclinical studies revealed strong potency and tumor regressions driven by enozertinib across a broad range of atypical EGFR mutant models. In a phase I clinical trial of enozertinib in patients with advanced NSCLC bearing atypical mutations in EGFR, a patient with harboring an EGFR exon 20 insertion experienced sustained complete response of all systemic and brain metastases. Together, these findings identify enozertinib as a promising investigational inhibitor to meet the unmet need for brain-penetrant therapies for NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertions or other atypical mutations."

      "abstract": "The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer (LC) screening trial (Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek [NELSON]) demonstrated low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduces LC mortality by 24% among men. The NELSON protocol differed from previous trials in the eligibility criteria, the use of volume-based nodule management, and increasing screening intervals. The early-stage sensitivity of the protocol is pivotal in determining the optimal screening strategy, such as the interval and age range. The MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis-Lung natural history model was used to reproduce LC incidence and mortality by detection method (clinical or screen-detected), sex, histology, and stage in the NELSON trial based on individual-level data. We evaluated screening effectiveness by stage and histology, accounting for population characteristics, trial design, and LC epidemiology. We find stage IA non-small cell LC (NSCLC) sensitivity of 24.6% (other NSCLC) to 41.0% (adenocarcinoma) at baseline screening. At repeat screening rounds, we find this increased to 70.9% for stage IA adenocarcinoma. For stage IB, the sensitivity by histology ranges from 26.4% to 77.1%; for stage II, 39.6%-81.9%. Upon detection, the probability of LC mortality prevention is estimated at 83% for stage IA. The sensitivity for detecting early-stage LC is found to depend on the histology of cancer and is increased for adenocarcinoma at repeat screenings. Despite a low rate of referral to follow-up screening in the NELSON trial, early-stage CT sensitivity and the probability of mortality prevention were similar to previous estimates from the National Lung cancer Screening Trial. Previously demonstrated screening effectiveness may be maintained when implementing new programs, while reducing unnecessary follow-up when considering NELSON evidence."

However, the complete clinical benefit of first-line amivantamab-chemotherapy is not fully understood, nor is the survival advantage in the presence of per-protocol crossover from chemotherapy to amivantamab after progression.\n\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) and time to subsequent therapy (TTST), at the time of primary analysis for progression-free survival, and the effect of the crossover design on overall survival at the time of interim analysis.\n\nMETHODS: In the phase III PAPILLON study, 308 participants were randomized (amivantamab-chemotherapy, n = 153; chemotherapy, n = 155). Intravenous amivantamab was administered every 3 weeks. Chemotherapy was administered as carboplatin for four cycles and pemetrexed until disease progression. TTD and TTST were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Crossover-adjusted survival estimates were generated using three established statistical methods.\n\nRESULTS: At a median follow-up of 14.9 months, median TTD was 13.2 versus 7.5 months for amivantamab-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.38 [95% confidence interval 0.28-0.51]; nominal p < 0.0001). Median TTST was 17.7 versus 9.9 months (HR 0.35 [95% confidence interval 0.25-0.49]; nominal p < 0.0001). A total of 65/155 participants crossed over from chemotherapy to amivantamab after progression. The crossover-adjusted overall survival continued to demonstrate a favorable survival benefit for amivantamab-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy with HRs of 0.52-0.60, which is more pronounced than the planned interim intention-to-treat overall survival (HR of 0.67; 95% confidence interval 0.42-1.09).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In PAPILLON, TTD and TTST were substantially longer for amivantamab-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy at primary analysis (cut-off on 3 May 2023). Crossover-adjusted analyses of the planned interim overall survival demonstrated a greater benefit for amivantamab-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy, further supporting amivantamab-chemotherapy as the first-line standard of care in EGFR exon 20 insertion-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04538664."

Lung volume was measured on the 30% phase of 4D CT at initial and re-simulation scans. Associations between volume changes and symptomatic RP were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. To determine the optimal cut-off value, ROC analysis and the Youden index were utilized. RP was graded based on CTCAE v5.0.\n\nRESULTS: Among the 49 patients, seven (14.3%) developed symptomatic RP. Dosimetric parameters did not differ significantly between patients with and without RP. However, changes in ipsilateral lung volume were significantly associated with symptomatic RP. A volume decrease >130 cm³ or a relative reduction <-7% was predictive of RP (P = .001). The area under the ROC curve for absolute change and relative change of ipsilateral lung volume were 0.905 and 0.883, respectively.\n\nCONCLUSION: Ipsilateral lung volume reduction during RT may serve as an early predictor of symptomatic RP, independent of traditional dosimetric factors. Monitoring volume changes with re-simulation CT could enhance RP risk assessment and guide adaptive RT planning."

IMpower133 and CASPIAN established platinum-etoposide plus anti-PD-L1 antibody as standard first-line therapy for extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Real-world data in Korean patients are scarce. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of first-line chemo-immunotherapy in ES-SCLC and compared outcomes with pivotal trials.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients diagnosed with ES-SCLC between 2018 and 2021. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and time to next treatment (TTNT) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Multivariate Cox regression identified prognostic factors. Objective response rate (ORR) was assessed by RECIST v1.1, and histological subtypes evaluated.\n\nRESULTS: Among 177 patients, median age was 66 years (range, 42-91), with 63.8% aged ≥65; most were male (92.7%) and ECOG 0-1 (91.5%). Smoking history was present in 80.8%. Baseline brain and liver metastases occurred in 27.7% and 26%. Median follow-up was 27.2 months (range, 3.9-43.2). ORR was 74.5% (95% CI, 67.1-81.1). Median OS, PFS, and TTNT were 12.4 (95% CI, 11.6-14.9), 5.3 (95% CI, 5.1-5.87), and 5.6 months (95% CI, 1.43-38.27). In 49 patients with brain metastases, ORR was 63.2%, with no difference in efficacy. Local therapy for brain metastases improved OS (HR 0.42; p=0.012), while PFS was not different. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 90%, primarily grade ≥2 cytopenias; the most common immune-related event was grade 1 rash.\n\nCONCLUSION: In this real-world Korean cohort, first-line chemo-immunotherapy achieved outcomes comparable to pivotal trials, supporting its role as standard care for ES-SCLC in clinical practice."

Data were collected on patient demographics, cancer staging, treatment type, and time to PE onset.\n\nRESULTS: Among patients who developed PE during lung cancer treatment, the mean age was 66.82 ± 10.50 years. Females comprised 64.04% of cases, adenocarcinoma was identified in 60.38%, and stage IV lung cancer was present in 56.60%. First-line therapy was administered in 63.21% of cases, and 66.04% exhibited enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. The mean D-dimer level among this cohort was 3.559 μg/mL, indicating a heightened thrombotic risk. Temporally, 50.95% of PE cases occurred within 6 months of lung cancer diagnosis. Onset within 3 months following therapy initiation was observed across multiple modalities: 46.15% for chemotherapy, 34.78% for targeted therapy, and 77.78% following surgical intervention. Notably, 16.98% of PE events occurred during the initial chemotherapy cycle. The mean time to PE onset was 1.81 ± 2.51 months for patients undergoing surgery alone, compared to 15.52 ± 12.88 months for those receiving surgery combined with other treatments (P < 0.05). Surgical intervention was identified as an independent risk factor for PE. In early-stage lung cancer, the mean time to PE onset was significantly shorter, with a mean time of 16.38 ± 21.07 months (P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION: The timing and incidence of PE vary according to the type of antitumor therapy administered in lung cancer treatment. These findings underscore the importance of vigilant monitoring, personalized risk assessment, and targeted anticoagulation strategies throughout the therapeutic course."

We evaluated the pandemic's impact on platinum agent utilization in the Netherlands and compared overall survival (OS) and safety between cisplatin and carboplatin.\n\nMETHODS: Using Netherlands Cancer Registry data, first-line platinum-based treatments for LS-SCLC and extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) between 2018 and 2023 were analyzed. OS was evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses. Grades 3-5 treatment-related adverse events were studied in three hospitals.\n\nFINDINGS: Overall, 1683 LS-SCLC (carboplatin, N = 1011[60 %]; cisplatin, N = 672[40 %]) and 3668 ES-SCLC (carboplatin, N = 3002[82 %]; cisplatin, N = 666[18 %]) patients were included. During the pandemic, quarterly usage rates of carboplatin reached up to 81 % and 90 % in LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC, respectively. In LS-SCLC, univariable analysis showed significantly shorter median OS with carboplatin compared to cisplatin (17.9m vs. 26.3m; HR, 1.48; 95 %CI, 1.31-1.68; p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in ES-SCLC (8.0m vs. 9.3m; HR, 1.19; 95 %CI, 1.09-1.30; p < 0.001). However, multivariable analyses, after adjusting for confounders, showed no significant OS differences in either LS-SCLC (HR, 1.06; 95 %CI, 0.90-1.25; p = 0.463) or ES-SCLC (HR, 1.01; 95 %CI, 0.92-1.12; p = 0.785). Confounders were performance status (PS), age, sex, and chemoradiotherapy type for LS-SCLC, and PS, age, sex, stage, and liver metastases for ES-SCLC. Hematologic toxicity was higher with carboplatin, while cisplatin led to more nonhematologic toxicity.\n\nINTERPRETATION: These findings challenge the long-standing belief of cisplatin's superiority and support the adoption of carboplatin in SCLC."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Young adults are a minority of lung cancer (LC) patients, however, clinical presentation and cancer biology can differ. Here, we report the first German cohort study of young adults with LC.\n\nMETHODS: We included patients diagnosed with LC between 2019 and 2023 at the West German Cancer Centre (University Medicine Essen) in this retrospective cohort study. For analysis of clinicogenomic baseline characteristics and overall survival (OS), patients were stratified by age at diagnosis into a young cohort (YC; n = 56, ≤45 years), an older cohort (OC; n = 2.682, >45 years) and analysed across age decades.\n\nRESULTS: 71 of 2.738 patients with LC (2.59 %) were ≤ 45 years old. 56/71 were diagnosed with NSCLC or SCLC. YC frequently reported no history of smoking (21 % vs. 6 %; p < 0.001). Among YC, adenocarcinoma (59 % vs. 49 %) and NSCLC not-otherwise-specified (NSCLC NOS; 27 % vs. 8.2 %) were the dominant histological subtypes (p < 0.001). Stage IV disease was significantly more common in YC (stage IV: 66 % vs. 44 %; p = 0.005) with more frequent regional lymph node involvement (N1-N3 79 % vs. 56.9 %) and extrathoracic lymph node metastases (38 % vs. 14 %; p < 0.001). Frequent targetable genomic alterations in YC included ALK translocations (21 % vs. 2.2 %; p < 0.001). YC with metastatic NSCLC had similar median OS compared to OC, although OS was improved in those with targetable alterations.\n\nCONCLUSION: Early-onset LC is characterized by advanced disease stage, adenocarcinoma histopathology and frequent targetable genomic alterations, especially in patients without a history of smoking. Early diagnosis remains a critical unmet medical need in this subgroup of patients."

The aim of this study is to provide an up-to-date analysis on toxicities and outcomes associated with definitive radiation therapy (RT) in patients with ILD and early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC).\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception until June 2024, for studies including patients with ILD who underwent definitive RT alone for ES-NSCLC. Data including treatment-related mortality, toxicity, local control, and overall survival were collected and analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Of 3545 records reviewed, 24 studies were identified for full data abstraction, contributing a total of 705 patients. A specific ILD subtype was not reported for 71% (n = 502) of patients. ILD severity was not reported for 62% (n = 440) of patients. Risk of treatment-related mortality was 7.9%, with severe treatment-related respiratory toxicity 15.7%. A higher volume of lung receiving ≥5 Gy (V5) was significantly correlated with mortality. The estimated local control at 3 year was 76% and median overall survival was 2.5 years.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The relative merits of RT for the treatment of ES-NSCLC in patients with ILD should be considered in the context of the rates of treatment-related mortality and toxicity. Future studies would benefit from consistent reporting of ILD characteristics, which may help in risk stratification in this challenging clinical scenario."

      "abstract": "RNA splicing dysregulation has emerged as a hallmark of cancer and a promising therapeutic target; however, its full landscape in human solid cancer remains poorly characterized. To address this, we perform alternative splicing analyses using RNA-sequencing data from 751 lung adenocarcinoma samples from our cohort integrated with 519 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Visualization of splicing patterns using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding reveals substantial inter-tumor heterogeneity driven by distinct molecular subtypes and histological differentiation. We identify a unique molecular subtype associated with inactivating mutations in CMTR2, which encodes Cap-specific mRNA (nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase 2. CMTR2 mutations are observed in 3.8% of cases and are predominantly truncating mutations, which form an isolated cluster within the splicing landscape. Intrinsic and CRISPR-Cas9-engineered CMTR2 mutations disrupt alternative splicing and sensitize cancer cells to sulfonamide-based RNA splicing modulators and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Retrospective patient data confirm the increased sensitivity of CMTR2-deficient tumors to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized RNA splicing deficiency in human cancers and define a molecular subtype of lung adenocarcinoma driven by RNA splicing dysregulation, suggesting targets for therapeutic intervention in lung cancer."

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of longitudinal tumour dynamics, time-varying drug-related adverse events (DRAEs), and other clinical characteristics on long-term outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). An ambispective cohort of 277 patients was analysed and externally validated using independent clinical trial data from 470 patients in the Project Data Sphere. Individual tumour growth trajectories were characterised by predicted sum of the longest diameters (SLD) using tumour growth inhibition (TGI) modelling. Time-dependent Cox and parametric time-to-event models were then applied to evaluate the influence of predicted tumour growth trajectories, observed dynamic DRAE profiles, cross-sectional variables derived from these measures, and additional covariates on time-to-treatment failure (TTF) and progression-free survival (PFS). The TGI models effectively captured individual tumour dynamics. Across both Cox and parametric time-to-event models, prognostic factors consistently included DRAEs, baseline metastasis, EGFR-TKI treatment history, and the specific EGFR-TKI administered. Notably, grade 2 DRAEs were associated with an optimal balance between efficacy and safety, and this association remained robust in sensitivity analyses and was preliminarily validated using external data. These findings emphasise the clinical relevance of DRAE grades in indicating long-term clinical benefit. By linking manageable toxicity with durable therapeutic outcomes, the study provides valuable insights for developing safe and effective EGFR-TKI treatment strategies in patients with NSCLC."

ILD patients have a higher risk of lung cancer and worse prognosis, with increased susceptibility to radiotherapy (RT)-related toxicities due to ILD exacerbations. There are no clear guidelines for managing lung cancer patients with ILD undergoing RT, alone or with systemic therapies. This work aims to establish a consensus on ILD assessment, patient selection, risk/benefit analysis, and clinical management for those eligible for thoracic RT.\n\nMETHODS: Using the Estimate-Talk-Estimate method, a board of experts (4 radiation oncologists, 2 pneumologists, 1 radiologist, 1 medical oncologist) identified key items. Each expert drafted statements for these items, and an extended panel of 24 experts (12 radiation oncologists, 6 pneumologists, 3 radiologists, 3 medical oncologists) rated the statements on a 9-point scale. Consensus was defined as a median score ≥ 7.\n\nRESULTS: Sixteen statements from 10 items reached consensus. The consensus points reached concern the clinical, radiological and functional assesment of patients with ILD, the role of the multidisciplinary team, the accurate evaluation of toxicity predictors, the prevention of complications and the risk/benefit ratio in different clinical scenarios in which radiotherapy is administered alone or in combination with antineoplastic drugs. Conclusion This multidisciplinary consensus on thoracic RT for lung cancer patients with ILD provides valuable guidance for clinicians managing this complex scenario."

Screening selection criteria vary, with some programmes only recommending screening for people who are surgical candidates, whereas others make no reference to fitness for surgery. Here we report clinical characteristics and outcomes for participants in the Yorkshire Lung Screening Trial with screen-detected clinical stage I lung cancer according to treatment modality.\n\nMETHODS: Consecutive participants with screen-detected clinical stage I lung cancer were stratified according to curative treatment modality into surgical and SABR cohorts. Factors associated with overall survival and cancer-specific survival were assessed with a median follow-up of 3.6 years.\n\nRESULTS: Of 190 patients with stage I lung cancer studied, 31 % (n = 58) received SABR and 69 % (n = 132) surgery (55 lobectomy, 77 sub-lobar resection). Patients treated with SABR were older with worse performance status and fitness parameters. Cancer-specific survival was similar between the SABR and surgery cohorts (HR for death 1.19, 95 % CI 0.45-3.14, p = 0.72) but overall survival was worse following SABR compared to surgery (HR for death 2.61 95 % CI 1.45-4.69, p = 0.001), indicating that the worse overall survival was due to non-cancer deaths. In the SABR cohort 17 patients (29.3 %) died from non-cancer causes during the study follow-up period compared with 9 (6.8 %) in the surgery cohort. Three-year survival was 69.4 % in the SABR cohort and 92.4 % in the surgical cohort (p < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Cancer-specific survival was similar between the two groups, but overall survival following SABR for screen-detected stage I lung cancer is worse than surgery due to higher rates of non-cancer death within 5 years of treatment. Lung cancer sojourn time has been estimated at around 5 years, so it is likely that rates of overdiagnosis are higher in patients treated with SABR compared to surgery. Further research may be needed to optimise inclusion and exclusion criteria for lung cancer screening."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common histological subtype of lung cancer with high metastatic propensity. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role in tumor metastasis, but the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. This study investigates the role of RIPK2 in EMT and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nMETHODS: TCGA database analysis determined RIPK2 expression and clinical significance. RNA interference, overexpression, qRT-PCR, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence were employed in A549 and PC-9 cell lines. Transwell, EdU, colony formation assays, and cytoskeletal staining assessed cell invasion, proliferation, and EMT changes. Nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) fusion proteins investigated subcellular localization effects. Tail vein injection in nude mice validated in vivo effects.\n\nRESULTS: RIPK2 was highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and associated with poor prognosis. RIPK2 knockdown inhibited while overexpression promoted EMT, invasion, and metastasis. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confirmed direct RIPK2-STAT3 interaction. RIPK2 specifically upregulated EMT transcription factor SNAIL expression. Co-expression of RIPK2 and SNAIL correlated with shorter patient survival. STAT3 or SNAIL knockdown inhibited RIPK2-induced EMT and metastasis. Nuclear-localized RIPK2 completely restored cellular EMT, invasion, and metastatic capabilities while enhancing cisplatin resistance.\n\nCONCLUSION: RIPK2 translocates to the nucleus, interacts with STAT3, and synergistically upregulates SNAIL expression, promoting EMT, invasion, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. The RIPK2-STAT3-SNAIL signaling axis represents a potential therapeutic target."
