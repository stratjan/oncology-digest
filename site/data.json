      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (CT) remains underused in the US, partly because of incomplete smoking history documentation in electronic health records (EHRs) and limited time for shared decision-making in primary care.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether a patient-facing, EHR-integrated tool combined with clinician-facing clinical decision support improves the identification of LCS-eligible patients and the ordering of low-dose CT compared with clinician-facing tools alone.\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pragmatic, unstratified, randomized clinical trial with parallel groups was conducted from March 29, 2024, to March 28, 2025, at primary care clinics at University of Utah Health and New York University Langone Health. Adults aged 50 to 79 years with a documented smoking history, an active patient portal account, and a primary care visit in the preceding year were included. Study 1 enrolled patients with uncertain LCS eligibility (10 to 19 pack-years, unknown pack-years, or missing quit date); study 2 enrolled patients with documented eligibility (20 or more pack-years and currently smoking or quit smoking within 15 years).\n\nINTERVENTIONS: The control included the clinician-facing Decision Precision+ tool (preventive care reminders and a shared decision-making tool). The intervention included the Decision Precision+ tool as well as the MyLungHealth tool, which collected detailed smoking history (study 1) and delivered personalized education and risk/benefit information (studies 1 and 2) via the patient portal in English and Spanish.\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients newly identified as eligible for LCS (study 1) and low-dose CT ordering rates (study 2) over 12 months. Analyses used intention-to-treat mixed-effects logistic regression.\n\nRESULTS: There were 31 303 randomized participants, including 26 729 in study 1 (13 144 [49.2%] female; 13 580 [50.8%] male; median [IQR] age, 62 [55-69] years) and 4574 in study 2 (2230 [48.8%] female; 2344 [51.2%] male; median [IQR] age, 63 [56-69] years). In study 1, the MyLungHealth tool increased new LCS eligibility identification (635 of 13 412 [4.7%] vs 308 of 13 317 [2.3%]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.99-2.42; P < .001). In study 2, low-dose CT ordering was higher in the intervention arm (474 of 2312 [20.5%] vs 434 of 2262 [19.2%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04-1.30; P = .008).\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, integrating a patient-centered tool into primary care EHR workflows increased the identification of patients eligible for LCS and the ordering of low-dose CTs. The relative increases in these primary outcomes were substantial, but absolute increases were more modest. Research on more intensive interventions is warranted to evaluate their ability to further improve LCS screening.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06338592."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of several cancers diagnosed before age 50 years has increased, contemporary trends in early-onset lung cancer remain poorly defined, particularly across histologic and sociodemographic subgroups.\n\nMETHODS: A population-based cohort study was conducted via Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 22 Program registries of 81,568 individuals diagnosed with lung cancer at age 20-49 years from 2000 to 2021. Age-adjusted incidence rates and annual percent change (APC) were estimated via National Cancer Institute Joinpoint regression. Overall trends were stratified by histology, sex, race/ethnicity, and state-level smoking prevalence.\n\nRESULTS: From 2000 to 2021, early-onset lung cancer incidence declined overall (average APC, -3.81%; 95% CI, -4.01% to -3.64%; p < .0001), which contrasts with rising early-onset colorectal and female breast cancers. Declines among females occurred later but were steeper for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD; -5.14% vs. -2.82%), whereas males declined faster for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and overall. Female declines were slower relative to males in Hispanic and non-Hispanic (NH) Black individuals (2.3- and 1.08-fold difference, respectively), whereas NH White females declined 1.3-fold faster than males. Among Asian females, NSCLC incidence did not decline, and LUAD increased through 2017 (+2.45%) and remained stable in Hispanic females. In high-smoking states, male rates declined steadily (-4.32%), whereas female rates were stable until 2010, then dropped sharply, and converged with males by 2021. In low-smoking states, male rates declined 48.75% faster than female rates (-4.76% vs. -3.20%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Early-onset lung cancer incidence declined overall from 2000 to 2021, except for persistent or rising LUAD among Asian and Hispanic females, which implicates emerging non-tobacco risk factors and highlights the need for targeted prevention."

      "abstract": "Capmatinib and tepotinib are selective MET inhibitors for MET exon 14 skipping non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet comprehensive real-world safety profiles, particularly concerning respiratory and rare adverse events (AEs), remain limited. We conducted a disproportionality analysis of the FDA AE Reporting System (FAERS) database, utilizing four algorithms (ROR, PRR, BCPNN, MGPS) to identify AE signals from 1771 cases for capmatinib and 470 for tepotinib, standardized with MedDRA v26.0. Both inhibitors shared signals for systemic AEs, such as peripheral oedema and gastrointestinal disorders. However, their respiratory AE profiles diverged: capmatinib was associated with pleural effusion and pulmonary oedema, whereas tepotinib was linked to infectious complications, including interstitial lung disease and infectious pleural effusion. Importantly, we identified significant novel signals beyond current drug labels: sensory disturbances, and thrombosis for capmatinib; and fluid imbalance-related events for tepotinib. These distinct AE profiles highlight an infection-driven pulmonary risk for tepotinib requiring close monitoring, while capmatinib's association with sensory disorders warrants specific patient management considerations. Our findings underscore the need for individualized safety monitoring based on the unique AE profiles of each MET inhibitor."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common histological subtype of lung cancer with high metastatic propensity. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role in tumor metastasis, but the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. This study investigates the role of RIPK2 in EMT and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nMETHODS: TCGA database analysis determined RIPK2 expression and clinical significance. RNA interference, overexpression, qRT-PCR, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence were employed in A549 and PC-9 cell lines. Transwell, EdU, colony formation assays, and cytoskeletal staining assessed cell invasion, proliferation, and EMT changes. Nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) fusion proteins investigated subcellular localization effects. Tail vein injection in nude mice validated in vivo effects.\n\nRESULTS: RIPK2 was highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and associated with poor prognosis. RIPK2 knockdown inhibited while overexpression promoted EMT, invasion, and metastasis. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confirmed direct RIPK2-STAT3 interaction. RIPK2 specifically upregulated EMT transcription factor SNAIL expression. Co-expression of RIPK2 and SNAIL correlated with shorter patient survival. STAT3 or SNAIL knockdown inhibited RIPK2-induced EMT and metastasis. Nuclear-localized RIPK2 completely restored cellular EMT, invasion, and metastatic capabilities while enhancing cisplatin resistance.\n\nCONCLUSION: RIPK2 translocates to the nucleus, interacts with STAT3, and synergistically upregulates SNAIL expression, promoting EMT, invasion, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. The RIPK2-STAT3-SNAIL signaling axis represents a potential therapeutic target."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: MET amplification is recognised as a de novo driver alteration in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but treatment responses with existing MET inhibitors remain largely unsatisfactory. We aimed to investigate the antitumour activity and safety of vebreltinib, a potent and highly selective MET inhibitor, in patients with MET amplification-driven NSCLC.\n\nMETHODS: KUNPENG was a multicentre, multi-cohort, single-arm, phase 2 trial conducted across 17 hospitals in China, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with MET dysregulation. Patients were eligible if they were MET inhibitor-naive, aged 18 years or older with MET amplification-driven NSCLC (gene copy number of six or higher), and progressed after previous standard chemotherapy or were ineligible for chemotherapy (cohort 2) or refused chemotherapy (cohort 3). Patients received 200 mg vebreltinib orally twice daily until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate, assessed by a masked independent review committee in the full analysis set. The study was amended to merge cohorts 2 and 3 due to slow accrual and was closed to enrolment on Nov 14, 2023. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04258033).\n\nFINDINGS: Between Jan 17, 2020, and Nov 14, 2023, 145 patients were enrolled; of these, 86 patients (30 chemotherapy-treated and 56 untreated) from cohorts 2 and 3 were included in the current analysis. The median age was 65 years (range 48-82; IQR 59-71), 77 (90%) patients were male, and nine (10%) were female. All patients were Chinese. 42 patients had partial response, resulting in an objective response rate of 48·8% (42 of 86; 95% CI 38·3-59·4) per masked independent review committee. The median follow-up was 18·6 months (IQR 15·7-37·3). The incidence of grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events was 31% (27 of 86), predominantly abnormal liver function terms reported by the investigators (eight [9%]). Serious adverse events related to treatment were reported by 16 (19%) patients. 11 treatment-emergent adverse events leading to death occurred, of which one patient died of abnormal liver function, which was possibly related to vebreltinib treatment.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Vebreltinib showed antitumour activity in patients with MET amplification-driven advanced NSCLC who had previously received chemotherapy or were chemotherapy-naive. Further research is needed to validate these findings.\n\nFUNDING: Beijing Pearl Biotechnology and Avistone Biotechnology."

      "abstract": "Resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remains a major obstacle in the clinical management of EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the transformative therapeutic activity of the multiple iterations of EGFR TKIs, spanning from first-generation reversible inhibitors such as erlotinib and gefitinib to the current standard-of-care third-generation covalent inhibitor osimertinib, primary or acquired resistance to these agents inevitably emerges via diverse mechanisms. The advent of combination therapies that incorporate chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, bispecific antibodies or antibody-drug conjugates has increased clinical benefit but introduced new resistance phenotypes, underscoring the dynamic plasticity and complexity of tumour evolution under therapeutic pressure. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the molecular mechanisms that underlie resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs, describe biomarker-guided and biomarker-unselected therapeutic strategies to overcome these mechanisms, and discuss emerging approaches to pre-empt resistance through early application of combination therapies. We highlight the paradigm shift from radiological to molecular monitoring of resistance to therapy and explore how advances in circulating tumour DNA analysis, artificial intelligence and multi-omics might facilitate adaptive treatment strategies. As the therapeutic landscape evolves, a more complete mechanistic understanding of resistance will be essential to guide rational treatment sequencing, inform trial design and improve long-term outcomes for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC."

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause for cancer related death worldwide. One treatment option for patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma is the targeted therapy gefitinib (Iressa®, ZD1839). As with other promising targeted therapies, desired in vivo effects of gefitinib came short to in vitro expectations, as preclinical testing is hampered by an inaccuracy of existing models and resistances develop frequently. We analysed the pharmacodynamics of gefitinib in a 3D tissue engineered human lung cancer model of HCC827 cells, as well as a resistant subpopulation of HCCres A2 cells. In 2D cell culture, a cell viability of 50 % was reached after treatment with 0.01-0.05 μM gefitinib. In the 3D model administering higher doses of gefitinib did not lead to a further reduction in viability and proliferation, or an increase in apoptosis. This shows that the pharmacodynamic effect of promising new therapies can often be overestimated in 2D versus 3D models. The results we obtained for gefitinib testing in the 3D models reflect astonishing well the efficacy of priorly published clinical data, suggesting that our 3D tumor models can display in vivo conditions more accurately, bridging the gap to living organisms. To mimic the clinical setting further, the lung cancer cells were cultivated under dynamic conditions in a bioreactor. The exploration of a resistant subpopulation confirmed an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The described 3D lung cancer model can be used as a refined, preclinical testing platform for targeted therapies and with clinically relevant pharmacodynamic properties as shown exemplary for gefitinib."

      "abstract": "Despite advances in immunotherapy, unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a highly challenging disease, with only around one-third of patients remaining disease-free at 5 years. The PACIFIC trial established consolidation with the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy as the standard-of-care approach. Furthermore, the LAURA trial has redefined the treatment of patients with stage III unresectable EGFR-mutant NSCLC, demonstrating unprecedented progression-free survival durations with osimertinib consolidation. Despite these advances, novel approaches are urgently needed. Circulating tumour DNA-based monitoring of minimal residual disease is emerging as a personalized method of tailoring treatment duration and escalation strategies. Novel radiotherapy techniques have the potential to provide synergy with immunotherapy while minimizing toxicities. Additionally, ongoing trials evaluating chemoimmunotherapy combinations adapted from the neoadjuvant setting with the potential for conversion to resectable disease might, in the near future, redefine the boundary of surgical resectability. In this Review, we describe the rapidly evolving field of unresectable stage III NSCLC, providing a state-of-the-art overview that includes challenging topics such as biomarkers, personalization of therapy and the role of immunotherapy rechallenge."

Multivariable analyses revealed strong dose-response relationships between radon exposure and both serum biomarkers and CT abnormalities. high radon exposure predicted substantial biomarker elevations including a 2.45-fold increase in CYFRA21-1 (β = 0.39, 95 % CI 0.25-0.54, p < 0.001), 1.60-fold increase in CEA (β = 0.20, 0.05-0.35, p = 0.008), and 3.58-fold increased CT abnormality risk (OR = 3.58, p = 0.023). Mediation analysis identified CYFRA21-1 as accounting for 69 % (p = 0.024) and CEA for 24.7 % (p = 0.036) of radon's effect on CT abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that occupational radon exposure contributes to pulmonary damage through both direct effects and biomarker-mediated pathways, with CYFRA21-1 and CEA emerging as potential early indicators of lung cancer in radon-exposed populations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leptomeningeal metastatic disease (LMD) represents a devastating complication of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a poor prognosis. Our understanding of LMD is limited in the era of molecular testing and emerging therapeutic options for lung cancer.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted an international, multicenter, retrospective study involving eight institutions across Asia, United States, and Europe. Patients diagnosed with LMD from advanced NSCLC were identified (2007-2024). Clinicopathological characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes were analyzed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from the LMD diagnosis (LMOS).\n\nRESULTS: A total of 2052 patients with NSCLC and LMD were included and analyzed by molecular subtypes: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (n = 1610), ALK (n = 141), other actionable genomic alterations (other AGA; n = 137), and non-AGA (n = 164). The cumulative prevalence of LMD by molecular subgroups was EGFR, 11.1%; ALK, 11.2%; ROS1, 16%; ERBB2, 12.3%, non-AGA, 3.6%. A higher proportion of LMD was diagnosed >3 years after initial metastatic diagnosis. By the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO)-European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) diagnostic criteria, type I (cerebrospinal fluid cytology positive) had significantly shorter LMOS than type II (magnetic resonance imaging and/or symptom positive). Median LMOS was 10.9 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.0-11.8 months] in all patients. Compared with historical cohorts, patients demonstrated improved LMOS in contemporary cohorts (7.3 versus 11.5 months, P < 0.0001), across all molecular subtypes. In AGA NSCLC, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were associated with improved LMOS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.39, 95% CI 0.31-0.48, P < 0.0001]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) conferred survival benefit in non-AGA patients (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25-0.84, P = 0.012). For the EGFR-mutated cohort, central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant TKI usage delayed LMD onset (P < 0.0001). Continued CNS-penetrant TKIs after LMD diagnosis were associated with longer LMOS (12.4 versus 6.0 months, P < 0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of LMD is rising, largely due to prolonged survival in advanced NSCLC. Contemporary systemic treatments, including TKIs and ICIs, were the main contributors to delayed LMD onset and improved LMD survival."

TRAF2 and NCK-interacting protein kinase (TNIK), an essential nuclear activator of Wnt/β-catenin target genes, has not yet been validated as a viable therapeutic target in SCLC. Here, we validated that TNIK inhibition is a promising approach for personalized anti-cancer therapy in SCLC.\n\nMETHODS: We correlated the IC50 values of a TNIK inhibitor, NCB-0846 with proteomic profiling (Reverse Phase Protein Array, RPPA) data across 28 SCLC cell lines. Cytokine array analysis was performed to quantify changes in 105 cytokines following TNIK inhibitor treatment.\n\nRESULTS: We identified c-MYC expression as a top candidate marker of TNIK inhibition response. In xenograft models of c-MYC\n\nCONCLUSIONS: TNIK inhibition is more effective in c-MYC"

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study describes clinical characteristics, treatment patterns as well as safety outcomes of NSCLC patients harboring PD-L1 ≥ 50% who received adjuvant atezolizumab within the Italian real-world scenario.\n\nMETHODS: Patients with surgically resected NSCLC harboring EGFR/ALK wild type disease and PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50%, who received at least one cycle of adjuvant atezolizumab were included. Clinical-pathological and molecular data, safety and efficacy outcomes were collected from the Italian ATLAS real-world registry.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 132 patients were included across 45 Italian centers between July 2022 and August 2024. Lobectomy was performed in 81.1% of cases, with 8.3% pathological stage IIA, 40.2% stage IIB, 43.9% stage IIIA, and 7.6% stage IIIB, according to the 8th TNM staging edition. The median number of atezolizumab cycles was 12.5 (range: 1-20). Treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) during atezolizumab were reported in 44 patients (33.3%), including 11 (8.3%) who experienced multiple TRAEs. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were reported in 21 cases (15.9%), leading to treatment discontinuation in 18 (13.6%). The median time to the first onset of TRAEs was 89 days (range: 3-390 days). 15 patients experienced a disease recurrence, including 6 locoregional-only and 9 distant relapses, with a median time since surgery of 13.3 months.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study showed that the safety profile of adjuvant atezolizumab outside of a clinical trial context was comparable to the IMPower-010 study, highlighting the value of the Italian ATLAS registry as source of real-word evidence to optimize the clinical management of NSCLC patients."
