      "abstract": "Dysregulated ISC metabolism has been implicated in cancer progression, but its role in LUAD pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that ISC biogenesis is significantly upregulated in LUAD, driven by transcription factors KLF15 and ZNF384, which activate GLRX5, LYRM4, NFS1 and BOLA3 promoters. IL-1β promotes PCAF mitochondrial translocation, releasing EP300 to amplify KLF15/ZNF384-mediated transcriptional activation. The natural monoterpenoid Hinokitiol inhibits LUAD growth by disrupting EP300-KLF15/ZNF384 interactions, suppressing ISC biogenesis gene expression and inducing ferroptosis. Mechanistically, the membrane protein TMDD1, particularly its cytoplasmic domain, promotes Hinokitiol's anti-tumor effects by facilitating EP300-KLF15/ZNF384 dissociation and inhibiting ISC biogenesis. Remarkably, Hinokitiol exhibits stage-dependent efficacy, with superior suppression of metastatic (stage IV) tumors linked to heightened ferroptosis sensitivity. This study not only elucidates the transcriptional machinery governing ISC biogenesis in LUAD but also highlights Hinokitiol's dual mechanism as a promising stage-specific therapeutic agent, offering novel strategies for advanced disease management."

      "abstract": "The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer (LC) screening trial (Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek [NELSON]) demonstrated low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduces LC mortality by 24% among men. The NELSON protocol differed from previous trials in the eligibility criteria, the use of volume-based nodule management, and increasing screening intervals. The early-stage sensitivity of the protocol is pivotal in determining the optimal screening strategy, such as the interval and age range. The MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis-Lung natural history model was used to reproduce LC incidence and mortality by detection method (clinical or screen-detected), sex, histology, and stage in the NELSON trial based on individual-level data. We evaluated screening effectiveness by stage and histology, accounting for population characteristics, trial design, and LC epidemiology. We find stage IA non-small cell LC (NSCLC) sensitivity of 24.6% (other NSCLC) to 41.0% (adenocarcinoma) at baseline screening. At repeat screening rounds, we find this increased to 70.9% for stage IA adenocarcinoma. For stage IB, the sensitivity by histology ranges from 26.4% to 77.1%; for stage II, 39.6%-81.9%. Upon detection, the probability of LC mortality prevention is estimated at 83% for stage IA. The sensitivity for detecting early-stage LC is found to depend on the histology of cancer and is increased for adenocarcinoma at repeat screenings. Despite a low rate of referral to follow-up screening in the NELSON trial, early-stage CT sensitivity and the probability of mortality prevention were similar to previous estimates from the National Lung cancer Screening Trial. Previously demonstrated screening effectiveness may be maintained when implementing new programs, while reducing unnecessary follow-up when considering NELSON evidence."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Subcutaneous (SC) formulations of oncology therapies could provide time-saving benefits for both patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) compared with intravenous (IV) delivery. This prospective observational study, conducted alongside the MK-3475A-D77 phase 3, open-label randomized clinical trial, quantifies HCP and patient time with pembrolizumab SC versus pembrolizumab IV among patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nMETHODS: Seventeen sites across eight countries in Europe (n = 4), South America (n = 3), and Asia (n = 1) were enrolled. Primary endpoints were active HCP time; patient time in the treatment chair, treatment room, and healthcare facility; and consumables usage. Descriptive statistics included weighted mean (WM), and a linear mixed model (LMM) was employed to explore differences in time measures between pembrolizumab SC and pembrolizumab IV per visit.\n\nRESULTS: Overall, 212 observations were analyzed (153 SC and 59 IV). Total active HCP time was reduced by 45.6% with SC versus IV (WM, 14.0 vs 25.8 min); HCPs spent 44.3% less time on the drug preparation process with SC versus IV (WM, 5.1 vs 9.1 min) and 46.3% less time on the drug administration process with SC versus IV (WM, 8.9 vs 16.7 min). Patient chair time was reduced by 49.6% with SC versus IV (WM, 59.0 vs 117.2 min). Patients receiving SC spent less time in the treatment room than those receiving IV (WM, 66.7 vs 126.9 min; difference - 47.4%). Exploratory LMM showed considerable between-group differences for active HCP time and patient time in the treatment chair and treatment room.\n\nCONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab SC substantially reduces active HCP time and patient chair time versus pembrolizumab IV. Time liberated for HCPs could be reallocated toward additional patient care activities, while optimized chair utilization could improve overall healthcare efficiency."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate staging of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential to determine further management. Current guidelines recommend confirmatory mediastinoscopy for patients with suspicious mediastinal lymph node metastases in image-based staging but negative findings on endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). In clinical practice, adherence to these recommendations is low and many physicians omit invasive surgical staging. This study aimed to assess the results of subsequent video-assisted mediastinoscopic lymphadenectomy (VAMLA).\n\nMETHODS: Retrospective single-center cohort analysis of patients who underwent surgery between 2015 and 2019. All patients were diagnosed with potentially resectable lung cancer or FDG-avid pulmonary nodule suspicious for NSCLC and underwent VAMLA following N0-N2 EBUS-TBNA for mediastinal staging.\n\nRESULTS: VAMLA was performed in 228 patients. Nodal upstaging after EBUS-TBNA occurred in 17.5 % of the cases (n = 40). During EBUS-TBNA, 1.72 (±1.06) lymph node stations were sampled, compared to 5.59 (±1.1) resected stations in VAMLA (p < 0.001). Clinical nodal status staged by PET/CT was significantly correlated with the occurrence of nodal upstaging by VAMLA, with an odds ratio of 7.69 in cN2 and 5.88 in patients with cN3, compared to cN0. Complications occurred in 8 patients (3.59 %). VAMLA was false negative in 1 patient (0.4 %).\n\nCONCLUSION: Subsequent VAMLA enables the accurate staging of patients after negative EBUS-TBNA. Overall, 17.5 % of cases had nodal upstaging and would otherwise not have received guideline-compliant treatment for NSCLC. These results underline the role of surgical mediastinal staging after negative EBUS-TBNA in patients with suspicious radiologic findings."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to characterize the association between pulmonary embolism (PE) onset time and various antitumor therapeutic approaches in patients with lung cancer, with the goal of identifying potential high-risk populations.\n\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical records from 2019 to 2025, among the 84,000 inpatients with lung cancer, 106 patients developed PE during hospitalization for antitumor treatment, who were confirmed using spiral computed tomography or pulmonary angiography per Chinese Thoracic Society (2018) and The New England Journal of Medicine (2010) criteria. Data were collected on patient demographics, cancer staging, treatment type, and time to PE onset.\n\nRESULTS: Among patients who developed PE during lung cancer treatment, the mean age was 66.82 ± 10.50 years. Females comprised 64.04% of cases, adenocarcinoma was identified in 60.38%, and stage IV lung cancer was present in 56.60%. First-line therapy was administered in 63.21% of cases, and 66.04% exhibited enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. The mean D-dimer level among this cohort was 3.559 μg/mL, indicating a heightened thrombotic risk. Temporally, 50.95% of PE cases occurred within 6 months of lung cancer diagnosis. Onset within 3 months following therapy initiation was observed across multiple modalities: 46.15% for chemotherapy, 34.78% for targeted therapy, and 77.78% following surgical intervention. Notably, 16.98% of PE events occurred during the initial chemotherapy cycle. The mean time to PE onset was 1.81 ± 2.51 months for patients undergoing surgery alone, compared to 15.52 ± 12.88 months for those receiving surgery combined with other treatments (P < 0.05). Surgical intervention was identified as an independent risk factor for PE. In early-stage lung cancer, the mean time to PE onset was significantly shorter, with a mean time of 16.38 ± 21.07 months (P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION: The timing and incidence of PE vary according to the type of antitumor therapy administered in lung cancer treatment. These findings underscore the importance of vigilant monitoring, personalized risk assessment, and targeted anticoagulation strategies throughout the therapeutic course."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend cisplatin as the preferred platinum agent in the first-line treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), especially limited-stage disease (LS-SCLC). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, carboplatin use likely increased due to logistical advantages. We evaluated the pandemic's impact on platinum agent utilization in the Netherlands and compared overall survival (OS) and safety between cisplatin and carboplatin.\n\nMETHODS: Using Netherlands Cancer Registry data, first-line platinum-based treatments for LS-SCLC and extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) between 2018 and 2023 were analyzed. OS was evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses. Grades 3-5 treatment-related adverse events were studied in three hospitals.\n\nFINDINGS: Overall, 1683 LS-SCLC (carboplatin, N = 1011[60 %]; cisplatin, N = 672[40 %]) and 3668 ES-SCLC (carboplatin, N = 3002[82 %]; cisplatin, N = 666[18 %]) patients were included. During the pandemic, quarterly usage rates of carboplatin reached up to 81 % and 90 % in LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC, respectively. In LS-SCLC, univariable analysis showed significantly shorter median OS with carboplatin compared to cisplatin (17.9m vs. 26.3m; HR, 1.48; 95 %CI, 1.31-1.68; p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in ES-SCLC (8.0m vs. 9.3m; HR, 1.19; 95 %CI, 1.09-1.30; p < 0.001). However, multivariable analyses, after adjusting for confounders, showed no significant OS differences in either LS-SCLC (HR, 1.06; 95 %CI, 0.90-1.25; p = 0.463) or ES-SCLC (HR, 1.01; 95 %CI, 0.92-1.12; p = 0.785). Confounders were performance status (PS), age, sex, and chemoradiotherapy type for LS-SCLC, and PS, age, sex, stage, and liver metastases for ES-SCLC. Hematologic toxicity was higher with carboplatin, while cisplatin led to more nonhematologic toxicity.\n\nINTERPRETATION: These findings challenge the long-standing belief of cisplatin's superiority and support the adoption of carboplatin in SCLC."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Young adults are a minority of lung cancer (LC) patients, however, clinical presentation and cancer biology can differ. Here, we report the first German cohort study of young adults with LC.\n\nMETHODS: We included patients diagnosed with LC between 2019 and 2023 at the West German Cancer Centre (University Medicine Essen) in this retrospective cohort study. For analysis of clinicogenomic baseline characteristics and overall survival (OS), patients were stratified by age at diagnosis into a young cohort (YC; n = 56, ≤45 years), an older cohort (OC; n = 2.682, >45 years) and analysed across age decades.\n\nRESULTS: 71 of 2.738 patients with LC (2.59 %) were ≤ 45 years old. 56/71 were diagnosed with NSCLC or SCLC. YC frequently reported no history of smoking (21 % vs. 6 %; p < 0.001). Among YC, adenocarcinoma (59 % vs. 49 %) and NSCLC not-otherwise-specified (NSCLC NOS; 27 % vs. 8.2 %) were the dominant histological subtypes (p < 0.001). Stage IV disease was significantly more common in YC (stage IV: 66 % vs. 44 %; p = 0.005) with more frequent regional lymph node involvement (N1-N3 79 % vs. 56.9 %) and extrathoracic lymph node metastases (38 % vs. 14 %; p < 0.001). Frequent targetable genomic alterations in YC included ALK translocations (21 % vs. 2.2 %; p < 0.001). YC with metastatic NSCLC had similar median OS compared to OC, although OS was improved in those with targetable alterations.\n\nCONCLUSION: Early-onset LC is characterized by advanced disease stage, adenocarcinoma histopathology and frequent targetable genomic alterations, especially in patients without a history of smoking. Early diagnosis remains a critical unmet medical need in this subgroup of patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) who develop lung cancer represent a unique challenge, as they are at higher risk for serious toxicity from local and systemic therapies. The aim of this study is to provide an up-to-date analysis on toxicities and outcomes associated with definitive radiation therapy (RT) in patients with ILD and early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC).\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception until June 2024, for studies including patients with ILD who underwent definitive RT alone for ES-NSCLC. Data including treatment-related mortality, toxicity, local control, and overall survival were collected and analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Of 3545 records reviewed, 24 studies were identified for full data abstraction, contributing a total of 705 patients. A specific ILD subtype was not reported for 71% (n = 502) of patients. ILD severity was not reported for 62% (n = 440) of patients. Risk of treatment-related mortality was 7.9%, with severe treatment-related respiratory toxicity 15.7%. A higher volume of lung receiving ≥5 Gy (V5) was significantly correlated with mortality. The estimated local control at 3 year was 76% and median overall survival was 2.5 years.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The relative merits of RT for the treatment of ES-NSCLC in patients with ILD should be considered in the context of the rates of treatment-related mortality and toxicity. Future studies would benefit from consistent reporting of ILD characteristics, which may help in risk stratification in this challenging clinical scenario."

This study investigates factors influencing outcomes with first-line MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) versus immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) ± chemotherapy.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clinicopathologic data were collected from patients with metastatic MET exon 14 skipping-mutant non-small cell lung cancer treated with first-line MET TKI or ICI ± chemotherapy at five centers. Primary endpoints were real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and overall survival (OS) to first-line MET TKI versus ICI ± chemotherapy. Subgroup analyses by clinical and tumor characteristics were performed.\n\nRESULTS: Among 158 patients, 80 received MET TKI and 78 received ICI ± chemotherapy as first-line treatment. Baseline clinicopathologic features were balanced except for a higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking in the ICI ± chemotherapy group (P = 0.03). With a median follow-up of 37.9 months, no difference was observed in rwPFS (HR, 0.85; P = 0.4) or OS (HR, 0.97; P = 0.9) with first-line MET TKI versus ICI ± chemotherapy. In subgroup analyses, first-line ICI ± chemotherapy improved rwPFS in PD-L1 ≥80% (HR, 0.50; P = 0.03), whereas MET TKI improved rwPFS (HR, 0.40; P = 0.005) and OS (HR, 0.49; P = 0.03) in PD-L1 <50%, as well as rwPFS (HR, 0.39; P = 0.02) and OS (HR, 0.36; P = 0.03) in brain metastases and rwPFS (HR, 0.55; P = 0.01) in bone metastases. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of high-grade toxicity (P = 0.9) or rates of permanent treatment discontinuation (P = 0.2) between first-line MET TKI and ICI ± chemotherapy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: First-line MET TKI improved outcomes in PD-L1 <50% and brain/bone metastases, whereas ICI ± chemotherapy prolonged PFS only in PD-L1 ≥80%, emphasizing the need for personalized treatment selection."

The panel formulated four PICO (population, intervention, comparison and outcomes) questions and seven complementary narrative questions. Both types of questions were assigned to groups of at least two experts. A medical librarian conducted the literature searches, and the authors selected relevant studies based on predefined inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS (Quality in Prognosis Studies) tool. Data were summarised and the certainty of evidence was assessed with GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) and the Evidence to Decisions framework was used to formulate recommendations. A series of multidisciplinary recommendations was formulated about the utilisation of pulmonary function tests, split lung function values, exercise tests, cardiologic testing, and the role of prehabilitation, sublobar resections, risk scores and comorbidities in selecting patients for curative intent treatment."

Baseline assessment (T0) data were collected at the first day of hospitalization, including demographic, clinical characteristics, psychological (psychological resilience, symptom burden, anxiety, medical coping styles), and social (social support) factors. Measurements were repeated at 3 days after surgery (T1), the day of hospital discharge (T2), 3 months post-discharge (T3), 6 months post-discharge (T4), and 1 year post-discharge (T5). A latent class growth model (LCGM) was used to define different classes of trajectories of psychological resilience.\n\nRESULTS: Data from 333 patients were analyzed. The three latent classes had a similar pattern across different intercepts, with a significant decrease from T0 to T2, followed by a significant increase from T2 to T5, and with T5 being higher than T0. The three trajectories were named Class 1 (sustained high), Class 2 (rapid recovery), and Class 3 (slow recovery), respectively. Multiple logistic regressions showed that Class 1 (sustained high) predicted higher social support, aged 20 ~ 40, being male and a civil servant, and Class 2 (rapid recovery), and Class 3 (slow recovery) predicted higher anxiety and resignation coping compared to Class 1.\n\nCONCLUSION: Healthcare providers should pay attention to periods of declining psychological resilience and implement interventions for vulnerable populations."

      "abstract": "Resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remains a major obstacle in the clinical management of EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the transformative therapeutic activity of the multiple iterations of EGFR TKIs, spanning from first-generation reversible inhibitors such as erlotinib and gefitinib to the current standard-of-care third-generation covalent inhibitor osimertinib, primary or acquired resistance to these agents inevitably emerges via diverse mechanisms. The advent of combination therapies that incorporate chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, bispecific antibodies or antibody-drug conjugates has increased clinical benefit but introduced new resistance phenotypes, underscoring the dynamic plasticity and complexity of tumour evolution under therapeutic pressure. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the molecular mechanisms that underlie resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs, describe biomarker-guided and biomarker-unselected therapeutic strategies to overcome these mechanisms, and discuss emerging approaches to pre-empt resistance through early application of combination therapies. We highlight the paradigm shift from radiological to molecular monitoring of resistance to therapy and explore how advances in circulating tumour DNA analysis, artificial intelligence and multi-omics might facilitate adaptive treatment strategies. As the therapeutic landscape evolves, a more complete mechanistic understanding of resistance will be essential to guide rational treatment sequencing, inform trial design and improve long-term outcomes for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC."

      "abstract": "KRAS mutations are responsible for a quarter of all lung adenocarcinomas. However, the molecular mechanisms linking these mutations and their frequent secondary dosage amplification to tumor formation are still not fully understood. While ample evidence supports a crucial role for the MAPK pathway in tumor development, the primary effectors targeted by this pathway remain largely unexplored. Here we identify the transcriptional repressor Capicua (CIC) as a key target inactivated by KRAS/MAPK signaling in lung adenocarcinoma. We show that genetic loss of CIC recapitulates the phenotypic consequences of amplified KRAS signaling. Genetic disruption of CIC suppressed the requirement for Kras allelic imbalances and accelerated the transformation of bronchiolar Club cells. We also demonstrate that restoring CIC repressor activity impaired proliferation of CIC-deficient tumor cells and reverted resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors. These results highlight the key role of CIC during lung tumor formation and suggest that selective pressure for effective CIC inactivation favors secondary amplification of KRAS/MAPK signaling in tumor cells."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% of lung cancers and is characterized by an aggressive disease course and historically poor prognosis. Although tumors in most patients respond to initial chemotherapy, relapse is nearly universal and treatment options remain limited. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a novel therapeutic class with the potential to address this unmet need.\n\nMETHODS: ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and their associated references and press releases were queried for the search terms \"antibody-drug -conjugates\" and \"SCLC.\" Only English-language sources were included.\n\nRESULTS: Multiple ADCs targeting diverse antigens have been evaluated in relapsed or refractory SCLC. Topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads have generated the most consistent activity across delta-like protein 3, TROP2, B7-H3, and SEZ6 targets, while microtubule and pyrrolobenzodiazepine-based constructs have not demonstrated durable benefit. Despite encouraging response rates, progression-free survival has remained short, reflecting intrinsic resistance, antigen heterogeneity, and toxicity-related dose limitations.\n\nCONCLUSION: While ADCs have generated encouraging response rates in SCLC, durability has remained limited. Future development will require optimization of payloads, linkers, and trial design to determine whether ADCs can achieve a sustained role in this disease."
