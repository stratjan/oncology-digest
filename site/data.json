      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite immunotherapy±chemotherapy has transformed the therapeutic landscape for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), critical questions remain regarding how detailed smoking history affects the evolving treatment options and the underlying molecular mechanisms driving these effects.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed 4157 patients with advanced NSCLC who were treated with immunotherapy monotherapy (IO alone) (n=2768) or chemoimmunotherapy (chemo-IO) (n=1389) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (2010-2023). Associations between detailed smoking history (status and cumulative pack-years) and clinical outcomes were assessed using multivariable analyses. First-line chemo-IO versus IO alone was compared in programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) of ≥50%\n\nRESULTS: In patients receiving IO alone, both smoking status and intensity showed dose-dependent associations with improved response and survival outcomes. In contrast, among patients receiving chemo-IO, smoking history did not affect initial response but patients with active (HR=0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94, p=0.01) and heavy tobacco use (HR=0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93, p=0.001) showed improved progression-free survival (PFS), and a trend toward improved overall survival (OS). Importantly, these associations remained independent of\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Detailed smoking history provides crucial insights for optimizing IO selection in advanced NSCLC through mechanistic alterations in both the tumor microenvironment and systemic plasma protein profiles."

      "abstract": "Multiplexed imaging of tissues is an approach that holds promise for improving early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. Here, we investigated multiplexed histological images of paired pre- and on-treatment samples from nine patients with immunotherapy-refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with an oral HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat) combined with a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab). Patient responses comprised of either stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). An extensive multiplexed-image analysis pipeline involving both cell segmentation and quadrats, coupled with spatial statistics, machine learning, and deep learning was built to analyze the spatial and temporal features that predict disease progression and identify potential clinical biomarkers. Distinct spatial immune ecologies existed between SD and PD patients, and tumors from PD patients were already characterized by an immune-suppressive environment prior to treatment. Finally, the learned spatial ecologies predicted disease progression better than PD-L1 status alone, suggesting these ecologies could be used as potential companion biomarkers with PD-L1 in NSCLC. These findings will be investigated in a larger-cohort study generated from an ongoing clinical trial (NCT02638090) that includes a wider range of responses including complete and partial responders. Together, this study developed a computational infrastructure for analyzing multiplex imaging to predict immunotherapy response in NSCLC, which can potentially be generalized to any type of cancer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of several cancers diagnosed before age 50 years has increased, contemporary trends in early-onset lung cancer remain poorly defined, particularly across histologic and sociodemographic subgroups.\n\nMETHODS: A population-based cohort study was conducted via Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 22 Program registries of 81,568 individuals diagnosed with lung cancer at age 20-49 years from 2000 to 2021. Age-adjusted incidence rates and annual percent change (APC) were estimated via National Cancer Institute Joinpoint regression. Overall trends were stratified by histology, sex, race/ethnicity, and state-level smoking prevalence.\n\nRESULTS: From 2000 to 2021, early-onset lung cancer incidence declined overall (average APC, -3.81%; 95% CI, -4.01% to -3.64%; p < .0001), which contrasts with rising early-onset colorectal and female breast cancers. Declines among females occurred later but were steeper for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD; -5.14% vs. -2.82%), whereas males declined faster for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and overall. Female declines were slower relative to males in Hispanic and non-Hispanic (NH) Black individuals (2.3- and 1.08-fold difference, respectively), whereas NH White females declined 1.3-fold faster than males. Among Asian females, NSCLC incidence did not decline, and LUAD increased through 2017 (+2.45%) and remained stable in Hispanic females. In high-smoking states, male rates declined steadily (-4.32%), whereas female rates were stable until 2010, then dropped sharply, and converged with males by 2021. In low-smoking states, male rates declined 48.75% faster than female rates (-4.76% vs. -3.20%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Early-onset lung cancer incidence declined overall from 2000 to 2021, except for persistent or rising LUAD among Asian and Hispanic females, which implicates emerging non-tobacco risk factors and highlights the need for targeted prevention."

      "abstract": "This meta-analysis evaluated the risk of malignancies and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) associated with the use of JAK inhibitors in patients with RA through a comprehensive meta-analysis of available clinical trials. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from inception to February 7, 2025, to identify relevant clinical trials. Data on malignancies and MACE incidence were extracted, and pooled risk ratios (RR) were calculated using a random-effects model. A total of 18 studies (N = 111,260) met the inclusion criteria. JAK inhibitors were associated with a significantly increased risk of malignancies excluding NMSC (RR = 1.30, 95%CI: 1.05, 1.60; P = 0.016), NMSC (RR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.23, 1.93; P < 0.01), overall malignancies (RR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.18, 2.00; P = 0.002), lung cancer (RR = 1.52, 95%CI: 1.11, 2.08; P = 0.009), lymphoma (RR = 3.69, 95%CI: 1.19, 11.42; P = 0.024), non-small cell lung cancer (RR = 1.70, 95%CI: 1.01, 2.86; P = 0.047), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (RR = 2.30, 95%CI: 1.44, 3.65; P < 0.01), and thyroid cancer (RR = 7.51, 95%CI: 1.39, 40.74; P = 0.019). In contrast, JAK inhibitors did not significantly alter the risk of MACE (RR = 0.75, 95%CI: 0.38, 1.45; P = 0.390), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (RR = 1.52, 95%CI: 0.90, 2.56; P = 0.117), or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR = 1.77, 95%CI: 0.84, 3.34; P = 0.079). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) confirmed data adequacy, and meta-regression indicated that sample size, treatment duration, and patient age did not influence outcomes. JAK inhibitors are associated with an elevated risk of malignancies but do not significantly affect MACE, VTE, or DVT risk in RA patients. Further large-scale post-marketing surveillance is warranted to refine the safety profile of JAK inhibitors in RA management."

      "abstract": "Capmatinib and tepotinib are selective MET inhibitors for MET exon 14 skipping non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet comprehensive real-world safety profiles, particularly concerning respiratory and rare adverse events (AEs), remain limited. We conducted a disproportionality analysis of the FDA AE Reporting System (FAERS) database, utilizing four algorithms (ROR, PRR, BCPNN, MGPS) to identify AE signals from 1771 cases for capmatinib and 470 for tepotinib, standardized with MedDRA v26.0. Both inhibitors shared signals for systemic AEs, such as peripheral oedema and gastrointestinal disorders. However, their respiratory AE profiles diverged: capmatinib was associated with pleural effusion and pulmonary oedema, whereas tepotinib was linked to infectious complications, including interstitial lung disease and infectious pleural effusion. Importantly, we identified significant novel signals beyond current drug labels: sensory disturbances, and thrombosis for capmatinib; and fluid imbalance-related events for tepotinib. These distinct AE profiles highlight an infection-driven pulmonary risk for tepotinib requiring close monitoring, while capmatinib's association with sensory disorders warrants specific patient management considerations. Our findings underscore the need for individualized safety monitoring based on the unique AE profiles of each MET inhibitor."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common histological subtype of lung cancer with high metastatic propensity. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role in tumor metastasis, but the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. This study investigates the role of RIPK2 in EMT and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nMETHODS: TCGA database analysis determined RIPK2 expression and clinical significance. RNA interference, overexpression, qRT-PCR, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence were employed in A549 and PC-9 cell lines. Transwell, EdU, colony formation assays, and cytoskeletal staining assessed cell invasion, proliferation, and EMT changes. Nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) fusion proteins investigated subcellular localization effects. Tail vein injection in nude mice validated in vivo effects.\n\nRESULTS: RIPK2 was highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and associated with poor prognosis. RIPK2 knockdown inhibited while overexpression promoted EMT, invasion, and metastasis. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confirmed direct RIPK2-STAT3 interaction. RIPK2 specifically upregulated EMT transcription factor SNAIL expression. Co-expression of RIPK2 and SNAIL correlated with shorter patient survival. STAT3 or SNAIL knockdown inhibited RIPK2-induced EMT and metastasis. Nuclear-localized RIPK2 completely restored cellular EMT, invasion, and metastatic capabilities while enhancing cisplatin resistance.\n\nCONCLUSION: RIPK2 translocates to the nucleus, interacts with STAT3, and synergistically upregulates SNAIL expression, promoting EMT, invasion, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. The RIPK2-STAT3-SNAIL signaling axis represents a potential therapeutic target."

      "abstract": "Resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remains a major obstacle in the clinical management of EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the transformative therapeutic activity of the multiple iterations of EGFR TKIs, spanning from first-generation reversible inhibitors such as erlotinib and gefitinib to the current standard-of-care third-generation covalent inhibitor osimertinib, primary or acquired resistance to these agents inevitably emerges via diverse mechanisms. The advent of combination therapies that incorporate chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, bispecific antibodies or antibody-drug conjugates has increased clinical benefit but introduced new resistance phenotypes, underscoring the dynamic plasticity and complexity of tumour evolution under therapeutic pressure. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the molecular mechanisms that underlie resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs, describe biomarker-guided and biomarker-unselected therapeutic strategies to overcome these mechanisms, and discuss emerging approaches to pre-empt resistance through early application of combination therapies. We highlight the paradigm shift from radiological to molecular monitoring of resistance to therapy and explore how advances in circulating tumour DNA analysis, artificial intelligence and multi-omics might facilitate adaptive treatment strategies. As the therapeutic landscape evolves, a more complete mechanistic understanding of resistance will be essential to guide rational treatment sequencing, inform trial design and improve long-term outcomes for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC."

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause for cancer related death worldwide. One treatment option for patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma is the targeted therapy gefitinib (Iressa®, ZD1839). As with other promising targeted therapies, desired in vivo effects of gefitinib came short to in vitro expectations, as preclinical testing is hampered by an inaccuracy of existing models and resistances develop frequently. We analysed the pharmacodynamics of gefitinib in a 3D tissue engineered human lung cancer model of HCC827 cells, as well as a resistant subpopulation of HCCres A2 cells. In 2D cell culture, a cell viability of 50 % was reached after treatment with 0.01-0.05 μM gefitinib. In the 3D model administering higher doses of gefitinib did not lead to a further reduction in viability and proliferation, or an increase in apoptosis. This shows that the pharmacodynamic effect of promising new therapies can often be overestimated in 2D versus 3D models. The results we obtained for gefitinib testing in the 3D models reflect astonishing well the efficacy of priorly published clinical data, suggesting that our 3D tumor models can display in vivo conditions more accurately, bridging the gap to living organisms. To mimic the clinical setting further, the lung cancer cells were cultivated under dynamic conditions in a bioreactor. The exploration of a resistant subpopulation confirmed an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The described 3D lung cancer model can be used as a refined, preclinical testing platform for targeted therapies and with clinically relevant pharmacodynamic properties as shown exemplary for gefitinib."

The PACIFIC trial established consolidation with the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy as the standard-of-care approach. Furthermore, the LAURA trial has redefined the treatment of patients with stage III unresectable EGFR-mutant NSCLC, demonstrating unprecedented progression-free survival durations with osimertinib consolidation. Despite these advances, novel approaches are urgently needed. Circulating tumour DNA-based monitoring of minimal residual disease is emerging as a personalized method of tailoring treatment duration and escalation strategies. Novel radiotherapy techniques have the potential to provide synergy with immunotherapy while minimizing toxicities. Additionally, ongoing trials evaluating chemoimmunotherapy combinations adapted from the neoadjuvant setting with the potential for conversion to resectable disease might, in the near future, redefine the boundary of surgical resectability. In this Review, we describe the rapidly evolving field of unresectable stage III NSCLC, providing a state-of-the-art overview that includes challenging topics such as biomarkers, personalization of therapy and the role of immunotherapy rechallenge."

      "abstract": "The objective of this research is to investigate the association between occupational radon exposure and pulmonary health outcomes in male miners from Chongqing, China. Between June 2022 and December 2023, 110 miners were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Personal radon exposure levels were measured using passive cumulative dosimeters, with pulmonary health assessed through radiologist-interpreted low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans and serum biomarker analysis (CEA, CYFRA21-1, NSE, and CA125) via ELISA. Multivariable analyses revealed strong dose-response relationships between radon exposure and both serum biomarkers and CT abnormalities. high radon exposure predicted substantial biomarker elevations including a 2.45-fold increase in CYFRA21-1 (β = 0.39, 95 % CI 0.25-0.54, p < 0.001), 1.60-fold increase in CEA (β = 0.20, 0.05-0.35, p = 0.008), and 3.58-fold increased CT abnormality risk (OR = 3.58, p = 0.023). Mediation analysis identified CYFRA21-1 as accounting for 69 % (p = 0.024) and CEA for 24.7 % (p = 0.036) of radon's effect on CT abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that occupational radon exposure contributes to pulmonary damage through both direct effects and biomarker-mediated pathways, with CYFRA21-1 and CEA emerging as potential early indicators of lung cancer in radon-exposed populations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leptomeningeal metastatic disease (LMD) represents a devastating complication of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a poor prognosis. Our understanding of LMD is limited in the era of molecular testing and emerging therapeutic options for lung cancer.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted an international, multicenter, retrospective study involving eight institutions across Asia, United States, and Europe. Patients diagnosed with LMD from advanced NSCLC were identified (2007-2024). Clinicopathological characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes were analyzed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from the LMD diagnosis (LMOS).\n\nRESULTS: A total of 2052 patients with NSCLC and LMD were included and analyzed by molecular subtypes: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (n = 1610), ALK (n = 141), other actionable genomic alterations (other AGA; n = 137), and non-AGA (n = 164). The cumulative prevalence of LMD by molecular subgroups was EGFR, 11.1%; ALK, 11.2%; ROS1, 16%; ERBB2, 12.3%, non-AGA, 3.6%. A higher proportion of LMD was diagnosed >3 years after initial metastatic diagnosis. By the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO)-European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) diagnostic criteria, type I (cerebrospinal fluid cytology positive) had significantly shorter LMOS than type II (magnetic resonance imaging and/or symptom positive). Median LMOS was 10.9 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.0-11.8 months] in all patients. Compared with historical cohorts, patients demonstrated improved LMOS in contemporary cohorts (7.3 versus 11.5 months, P < 0.0001), across all molecular subtypes. In AGA NSCLC, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were associated with improved LMOS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.39, 95% CI 0.31-0.48, P < 0.0001]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) conferred survival benefit in non-AGA patients (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25-0.84, P = 0.012). For the EGFR-mutated cohort, central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant TKI usage delayed LMD onset (P < 0.0001). Continued CNS-penetrant TKIs after LMD diagnosis were associated with longer LMOS (12.4 versus 6.0 months, P < 0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of LMD is rising, largely due to prolonged survival in advanced NSCLC. Contemporary systemic treatments, including TKIs and ICIs, were the main contributors to delayed LMD onset and improved LMD survival."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study describes clinical characteristics, treatment patterns as well as safety outcomes of NSCLC patients harboring PD-L1 ≥ 50% who received adjuvant atezolizumab within the Italian real-world scenario.\n\nMETHODS: Patients with surgically resected NSCLC harboring EGFR/ALK wild type disease and PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50%, who received at least one cycle of adjuvant atezolizumab were included. Clinical-pathological and molecular data, safety and efficacy outcomes were collected from the Italian ATLAS real-world registry.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 132 patients were included across 45 Italian centers between July 2022 and August 2024. Lobectomy was performed in 81.1% of cases, with 8.3% pathological stage IIA, 40.2% stage IIB, 43.9% stage IIIA, and 7.6% stage IIIB, according to the 8th TNM staging edition. The median number of atezolizumab cycles was 12.5 (range: 1-20). Treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) during atezolizumab were reported in 44 patients (33.3%), including 11 (8.3%) who experienced multiple TRAEs. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were reported in 21 cases (15.9%), leading to treatment discontinuation in 18 (13.6%). The median time to the first onset of TRAEs was 89 days (range: 3-390 days). 15 patients experienced a disease recurrence, including 6 locoregional-only and 9 distant relapses, with a median time since surgery of 13.3 months.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study showed that the safety profile of adjuvant atezolizumab outside of a clinical trial context was comparable to the IMPower-010 study, highlighting the value of the Italian ATLAS registry as source of real-word evidence to optimize the clinical management of NSCLC patients."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: While treatment strategies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continue to evolve, the prognostic implications of lymph node metastasis patterns in upper lobe tumors remain inadequately defined. This study investigated whether tumour laterality and specific nodal stations involved in N2a disease correlate with long-term survival in patients undergoing surgical resection for upper lobe NSCLC.\n\nMETHODS: This retrospective single-center study included patients with stage I-IIIB upper lobe NSCLC who underwent anatomical resection with systematic lymph node dissection from January 2010 to December 2022. Patients were stratified by tumour laterality and nodal involvement, with specific analysis of N2a subgroups based on lymph node station. Propensity score matching, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and log-rank testing were used to compare survival outcomes.\n\nRESULTS: Of 3,313 patients considered, 2,028 met the prespecified inclusion criteria (right: n = 1,212; left: n = 816). Mean age was 65.7 ± 9.4 years; 61.7% were male. Median overall survival (OS) was similar for right- and left-sided N0 and N1 tumors. Significant differences emerged among N2a subgroups: Patients with left-sided skip metastases to LN5/6 had markedly improved OS (66.2 ± 14.9 months) versus right-sided LN2/4 (35.3 ± 8.5 months; p = 0.047). Outcomes of left-sided N2a1 LN5/6 were also more favorable than LN7-9 (37.7 ± 15.2 months; p = 0.023) and showed better OS than left-sided N1 disease (47.6 ± 4.2 months; p = 0.284).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Positive nodal station and tumour laterality significantly impact survival in upper lobe NSCLC. Skip metastases to LN5/6 in left-sided tumors were linked to more favorable prognosis and may warrant inclusion in future TNM classification refinements."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: KRAS G12V is among the most frequent KRAS mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet its clinical and molecular features remain poorly understood.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this retrospective study, we analyzed 636 patients with KRAS G12V-mutated NSCLC diagnosed between 2018 and 2023. Clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics, including co-mutations, smoking history, PD-L1 expression, CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and treatment outcomes, were assessed.\n\nRESULTS: The majority of patients (94.2%) were current or former smokers, with a median tobacco exposure of 40 pack-years. Co-mutations were frequent, most commonly in TP53 (40.2%), STK11 (30.2%), and KEAP1 (29.3%). Heavy smokers exhibited significantly higher PD-L1 expression and more frequent TP53, KEAP1, and NTRK1-3mutations than light smokers. CD8+ T-cell infiltration showed a non-significant trend toward higher values in G12V compared to non-G12V KRAS subtypes. Among 151 patients with advanced disease, those treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) alone or in combination with chemotherapy had significantly higher response rates and improved real-world progression-free (rwPFS) and overall survival (rwOS) compared to chemotherapy alone. In patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, ICB-based treatment achieved a median rwOS of 30 months.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: KRAS G12V-mutated NSCLC is characterized by a strong association with tobacco use, high co-mutation rates in clinically relevant genes, and a favorable response to PD-L1-based immunotherapy. The observed mutation landscape supports the potential for dual checkpoint blockade in a significant subset."
