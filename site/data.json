      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Acquisition of resistance to anticancer therapies is a multistep process initiated by the survival of drug-tolerant persister cells. Accessibility of drug-tolerant persister cells in patients is limited, which has hindered understanding the mechanisms driving their emergence. In this study, using multiple patient-derived models to isolate persister cells, we showed that these cells are transcriptionally plastic in vivo and return to a common treatment naïve-like state upon relapse, regardless of treatment. Hallmarks of the persister state in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) across treatment modalities included high expression of basal keratins together with activation of stress response and inflammation pathways. These hallmarks were also activated in HER2+ breast and lung cancer cells in response to targeted therapies. Analysis of gene regulatory networks identified AP-1, NF-κB, and IRF/STAT as the key drivers of this hallmark persister state. Functionally, FOSL1, an AP-1 member, drove cells to the persister state by binding enhancers and reprogramming the transcriptome of cancer cells. On the contrary, cancer cells without FOSL1 had a decreased ability to reach the persister state. By defining hallmarks of TNBC persistence on multiple therapies, this study provides a resource to design effective combination therapeutic strategies that limit resistance.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: Elucidation of the features of the drug-tolerant persister state in triple-negative breast cancer reveals shared programs across patients and treatments that offer opportunities to prevent persistence and delay tumor recurrence."

      "abstract": "EGFR mutations are common oncogenic drivers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and around one-third of patients develop brain metastases over the course of their disease. Patients with non-classical EGFR mutations, such as insertions in exon 20, are a high unmet need with a worse prognosis compared to patients with classical EGFR mutations. Here, we describe the discovery and development of enozertinib (formerly ORIC-114), a highly brain-penetrant, orally bioavailable, irreversible inhibitor that targets EGFR exon 20 mutations with unparalleled kinome selectivity. Preclinical studies revealed strong potency and tumor regressions driven by enozertinib across a broad range of atypical EGFR mutant models. In a phase I clinical trial of enozertinib in patients with advanced NSCLC bearing atypical mutations in EGFR, a patient with harboring an EGFR exon 20 insertion experienced sustained complete response of all systemic and brain metastases. Together, these findings identify enozertinib as a promising investigational inhibitor to meet the unmet need for brain-penetrant therapies for NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertions or other atypical mutations."

      "abstract": "Dysregulated ISC metabolism has been implicated in cancer progression, but its role in LUAD pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that ISC biogenesis is significantly upregulated in LUAD, driven by transcription factors KLF15 and ZNF384, which activate GLRX5, LYRM4, NFS1 and BOLA3 promoters. IL-1β promotes PCAF mitochondrial translocation, releasing EP300 to amplify KLF15/ZNF384-mediated transcriptional activation. The natural monoterpenoid Hinokitiol inhibits LUAD growth by disrupting EP300-KLF15/ZNF384 interactions, suppressing ISC biogenesis gene expression and inducing ferroptosis. Mechanistically, the membrane protein TMDD1, particularly its cytoplasmic domain, promotes Hinokitiol's anti-tumor effects by facilitating EP300-KLF15/ZNF384 dissociation and inhibiting ISC biogenesis. Remarkably, Hinokitiol exhibits stage-dependent efficacy, with superior suppression of metastatic (stage IV) tumors linked to heightened ferroptosis sensitivity. This study not only elucidates the transcriptional machinery governing ISC biogenesis in LUAD but also highlights Hinokitiol's dual mechanism as a promising stage-specific therapeutic agent, offering novel strategies for advanced disease management."

      "abstract": "The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer (LC) screening trial (Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek [NELSON]) demonstrated low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduces LC mortality by 24% among men. The NELSON protocol differed from previous trials in the eligibility criteria, the use of volume-based nodule management, and increasing screening intervals. The early-stage sensitivity of the protocol is pivotal in determining the optimal screening strategy, such as the interval and age range. The MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis-Lung natural history model was used to reproduce LC incidence and mortality by detection method (clinical or screen-detected), sex, histology, and stage in the NELSON trial based on individual-level data. We evaluated screening effectiveness by stage and histology, accounting for population characteristics, trial design, and LC epidemiology. We find stage IA non-small cell LC (NSCLC) sensitivity of 24.6% (other NSCLC) to 41.0% (adenocarcinoma) at baseline screening. At repeat screening rounds, we find this increased to 70.9% for stage IA adenocarcinoma. For stage IB, the sensitivity by histology ranges from 26.4% to 77.1%; for stage II, 39.6%-81.9%. Upon detection, the probability of LC mortality prevention is estimated at 83% for stage IA. The sensitivity for detecting early-stage LC is found to depend on the histology of cancer and is increased for adenocarcinoma at repeat screenings. Despite a low rate of referral to follow-up screening in the NELSON trial, early-stage CT sensitivity and the probability of mortality prevention were similar to previous estimates from the National Lung cancer Screening Trial. Previously demonstrated screening effectiveness may be maintained when implementing new programs, while reducing unnecessary follow-up when considering NELSON evidence."

Lung volume was measured on the 30% phase of 4D CT at initial and re-simulation scans. Associations between volume changes and symptomatic RP were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. To determine the optimal cut-off value, ROC analysis and the Youden index were utilized. RP was graded based on CTCAE v5.0.\n\nRESULTS: Among the 49 patients, seven (14.3%) developed symptomatic RP. Dosimetric parameters did not differ significantly between patients with and without RP. However, changes in ipsilateral lung volume were significantly associated with symptomatic RP. A volume decrease >130 cm³ or a relative reduction <-7% was predictive of RP (P = .001). The area under the ROC curve for absolute change and relative change of ipsilateral lung volume were 0.905 and 0.883, respectively.\n\nCONCLUSION: Ipsilateral lung volume reduction during RT may serve as an early predictor of symptomatic RP, independent of traditional dosimetric factors.

IMpower133 and CASPIAN established platinum-etoposide plus anti-PD-L1 antibody as standard first-line therapy for extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Real-world data in Korean patients are scarce. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of first-line chemo-immunotherapy in ES-SCLC and compared outcomes with pivotal trials.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients diagnosed with ES-SCLC between 2018 and 2021. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and time to next treatment (TTNT) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Multivariate Cox regression identified prognostic factors. Objective response rate (ORR) was assessed by RECIST v1.1, and histological subtypes evaluated.\n\nRESULTS: Among 177 patients, median age was 66 years (range, 42-91), with 63.8% aged ≥65; most were male (92.7%) and ECOG 0-1 (91.5%). Smoking history was present in 80.8%. Baseline brain and liver metastases occurred in 27.7% and 26%. Median follow-up was 27.2 months (range, 3.9-43.2). ORR was 74.5% (95% CI, 67.1-81.1). Median OS, PFS, and TTNT were 12.4 (95% CI, 11.6-14.9), 5.3 (95% CI, 5.1-5.87), and 5.6 months (95% CI, 1.43-38.27). In 49 patients with brain metastases, ORR was 63.2%, with no difference in efficacy. Local therapy for brain metastases improved OS (HR 0.42; p=0.012), while PFS was not different. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 90%, primarily grade ≥2 cytopenias; the most common immune-related event was grade 1 rash.\n\nCONCLUSION: In this real-world Korean cohort, first-line chemo-immunotherapy achieved outcomes comparable to pivotal trials, supporting its role as standard care for ES-SCLC in clinical practice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate staging of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential to determine further management. Current guidelines recommend confirmatory mediastinoscopy for patients with suspicious mediastinal lymph node metastases in image-based staging but negative findings on endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). In clinical practice, adherence to these recommendations is low and many physicians omit invasive surgical staging. This study aimed to assess the results of subsequent video-assisted mediastinoscopic lymphadenectomy (VAMLA).\n\nMETHODS: Retrospective single-center cohort analysis of patients who underwent surgery between 2015 and 2019. All patients were diagnosed with potentially resectable lung cancer or FDG-avid pulmonary nodule suspicious for NSCLC and underwent VAMLA following N0-N2 EBUS-TBNA for mediastinal staging.\n\nRESULTS: VAMLA was performed in 228 patients. Nodal upstaging after EBUS-TBNA occurred in 17.5 % of the cases (n = 40). During EBUS-TBNA, 1.72 (±1.06) lymph node stations were sampled, compared to 5.59 (±1.1) resected stations in VAMLA (p < 0.001). Clinical nodal status staged by PET/CT was significantly correlated with the occurrence of nodal upstaging by VAMLA, with an odds ratio of 7.69 in cN2 and 5.88 in patients with cN3, compared to cN0. Complications occurred in 8 patients (3.59 %). VAMLA was false negative in 1 patient (0.4 %).\n\nCONCLUSION: Subsequent VAMLA enables the accurate staging of patients after negative EBUS-TBNA. Overall, 17.5 % of cases had nodal upstaging and would otherwise not have received guideline-compliant treatment for NSCLC. These results underline the role of surgical mediastinal staging after negative EBUS-TBNA in patients with suspicious radiologic findings."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to characterize the association between pulmonary embolism (PE) onset time and various antitumor therapeutic approaches in patients with lung cancer, with the goal of identifying potential high-risk populations.\n\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical records from 2019 to 2025, among the 84,000 inpatients with lung cancer, 106 patients developed PE during hospitalization for antitumor treatment, who were confirmed using spiral computed tomography or pulmonary angiography per Chinese Thoracic Society (2018) and The New England Journal of Medicine (2010) criteria. Data were collected on patient demographics, cancer staging, treatment type, and time to PE onset.\n\nRESULTS: Among patients who developed PE during lung cancer treatment, the mean age was 66.82 ± 10.50 years. Females comprised 64.04% of cases, adenocarcinoma was identified in 60.38%, and stage IV lung cancer was present in 56.60%. First-line therapy was administered in 63.21% of cases, and 66.04% exhibited enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. The mean D-dimer level among this cohort was 3.559 μg/mL, indicating a heightened thrombotic risk. Temporally, 50.95% of PE cases occurred within 6 months of lung cancer diagnosis. Onset within 3 months following therapy initiation was observed across multiple modalities: 46.15% for chemotherapy, 34.78% for targeted therapy, and 77.78% following surgical intervention. Notably, 16.98% of PE events occurred during the initial chemotherapy cycle. The mean time to PE onset was 1.81 ± 2.51 months for patients undergoing surgery alone, compared to 15.52 ± 12.88 months for those receiving surgery combined with other treatments (P < 0.05). Surgical intervention was identified as an independent risk factor for PE. In early-stage lung cancer, the mean time to PE onset was significantly shorter, with a mean time of 16.38 ± 21.07 months (P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION: The timing and incidence of PE vary according to the type of antitumor therapy administered in lung cancer treatment. These findings underscore the importance of vigilant monitoring, personalized risk assessment, and targeted anticoagulation strategies throughout the therapeutic course."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend cisplatin as the preferred platinum agent in the first-line treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), especially limited-stage disease (LS-SCLC). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, carboplatin use likely increased due to logistical advantages. We evaluated the pandemic's impact on platinum agent utilization in the Netherlands and compared overall survival (OS) and safety between cisplatin and carboplatin.\n\nMETHODS: Using Netherlands Cancer Registry data, first-line platinum-based treatments for LS-SCLC and extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) between 2018 and 2023 were analyzed. OS was evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses. Grades 3-5 treatment-related adverse events were studied in three hospitals.\n\nFINDINGS: Overall, 1683 LS-SCLC (carboplatin, N = 1011[60 %]; cisplatin, N = 672[40 %]) and 3668 ES-SCLC (carboplatin, N = 3002[82 %]; cisplatin, N = 666[18 %]) patients were included. During the pandemic, quarterly usage rates of carboplatin reached up to 81 % and 90 % in LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC, respectively. In LS-SCLC, univariable analysis showed significantly shorter median OS with carboplatin compared to cisplatin (17.9m vs. 26.3m; HR, 1.48; 95 %CI, 1.31-1.68; p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in ES-SCLC (8.0m vs. 9.3m; HR, 1.19; 95 %CI, 1.09-1.30; p < 0.001). However, multivariable analyses, after adjusting for confounders, showed no significant OS differences in either LS-SCLC (HR, 1.06; 95 %CI, 0.90-1.25; p = 0.463) or ES-SCLC (HR, 1.01; 95 %CI, 0.92-1.12; p = 0.785). Confounders were performance status (PS), age, sex, and chemoradiotherapy type for LS-SCLC, and PS, age, sex, stage, and liver metastases for ES-SCLC. Hematologic toxicity was higher with carboplatin, while cisplatin led to more nonhematologic toxicity.\n\nINTERPRETATION: These findings challenge the long-standing belief of cisplatin's superiority and support the adoption of carboplatin in SCLC."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Young adults are a minority of lung cancer (LC) patients, however, clinical presentation and cancer biology can differ. Here, we report the first German cohort study of young adults with LC.\n\nMETHODS: We included patients diagnosed with LC between 2019 and 2023 at the West German Cancer Centre (University Medicine Essen) in this retrospective cohort study. For analysis of clinicogenomic baseline characteristics and overall survival (OS), patients were stratified by age at diagnosis into a young cohort (YC; n = 56, ≤45 years), an older cohort (OC; n = 2.682, >45 years) and analysed across age decades.\n\nRESULTS: 71 of 2.738 patients with LC (2.59 %) were ≤ 45 years old. 56/71 were diagnosed with NSCLC or SCLC. YC frequently reported no history of smoking (21 % vs. 6 %; p < 0.001). Among YC, adenocarcinoma (59 % vs. 49 %) and NSCLC not-otherwise-specified (NSCLC NOS; 27 % vs. 8.2 %) were the dominant histological subtypes (p < 0.001). Stage IV disease was significantly more common in YC (stage IV: 66 % vs. 44 %; p = 0.005) with more frequent regional lymph node involvement (N1-N3 79 % vs. 56.9 %) and extrathoracic lymph node metastases (38 % vs. 14 %; p < 0.001). Frequent targetable genomic alterations in YC included ALK translocations (21 % vs. 2.2 %; p < 0.001). YC with metastatic NSCLC had similar median OS compared to OC, although OS was improved in those with targetable alterations.\n\nCONCLUSION: Early-onset LC is characterized by advanced disease stage, adenocarcinoma histopathology and frequent targetable genomic alterations, especially in patients without a history of smoking. Early diagnosis remains a critical unmet medical need in this subgroup of patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) who develop lung cancer represent a unique challenge, as they are at higher risk for serious toxicity from local and systemic therapies. The aim of this study is to provide an up-to-date analysis on toxicities and outcomes associated with definitive radiation therapy (RT) in patients with ILD and early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC).\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception until June 2024, for studies including patients with ILD who underwent definitive RT alone for ES-NSCLC. Data including treatment-related mortality, toxicity, local control, and overall survival were collected and analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Of 3545 records reviewed, 24 studies were identified for full data abstraction, contributing a total of 705 patients. A specific ILD subtype was not reported for 71% (n = 502) of patients. ILD severity was not reported for 62% (n = 440) of patients. Risk of treatment-related mortality was 7.9%, with severe treatment-related respiratory toxicity 15.7%. A higher volume of lung receiving ≥5 Gy (V5) was significantly correlated with mortality. The estimated local control at 3 year was 76% and median overall survival was 2.5 years.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The relative merits of RT for the treatment of ES-NSCLC in patients with ILD should be considered in the context of the rates of treatment-related mortality and toxicity. Future studies would benefit from consistent reporting of ILD characteristics, which may help in risk stratification in this challenging clinical scenario."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Brain metastasis (BM) is a devastating complication of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in NSCLC tumors harboring EGFR mutations. However, the genomic alterations driving BM remain poorly understood.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed three independent cohorts of resected NSCLCs from Asian patients, including 1,081 primary tumor (PT) samples analyzed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS, discovery cohort, n=180) or whole-exome sequencing (WES, validation cohort, n=901), 8 BM samples, and 17 matched primary-BM pairs analyzed by WGS (BM cohort). Furthermore, RNA sequencing of the available 172 samples in the validation cohort and drug sensitivity profiling using NSCLC cell lines were performed.\n\nRESULTS: In the discovery cohort, deletions of the 15q15 chromosomal segment were more enriched in PTs from patients with BM than in those without this deletion (73% vs. 39%, P=0.004). Cumulative BM incidence was significantly higher in PTs with the 15q15 deletion (sub-distribution hazard ratio=3.9, P=0.008 [Fine-Gray competing risk analysis]), whereas metastases at other organ sites did not differ significantly. These findings were obtained using the validation cohort. The 15q15 deletions significantly co-occurred with EGFR mutations (P=2.8×10\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The 15q15 deletion promotes BM development through aberrant MYC signaling and the subsequent reprogramming of carbohydrate metabolism."

Here, we apply a whole-genome, tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection approach to address this challenge, leveraging 1,800 variants across 2,994 plasma samples from 431 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the TRACERx study. We show that ultrasensitive ctDNA detection below 80 parts per million both pre- and postoperatively is highly prognostic, and combinatorial analysis of the pre- and postoperative ctDNA status identifies an intermediate risk group, improving disease stratification. ctDNA kinetics demonstrate clinical utility during adjuvant therapy, where patients that \"clear\" ctDNA during adjuvant therapy experience improved outcomes. Moreover, characterization of patterns in postoperative ctDNA kinetics reveals insights into the timing, risk, and anatomical pattern of relapses. By incorporating longitudinal ultrasensitive ctDNA detection, we propose a refined schema for guiding the stratification and treatment recommendations in early stage NSCLC."

Between June 2022 and December 2023, 110 miners were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Personal radon exposure levels were measured using passive cumulative dosimeters, with pulmonary health assessed through radiologist-interpreted low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans and serum biomarker analysis (CEA, CYFRA21-1, NSE, and CA125) via ELISA. Multivariable analyses revealed strong dose-response relationships between radon exposure and both serum biomarkers and CT abnormalities. high radon exposure predicted substantial biomarker elevations including a 2.45-fold increase in CYFRA21-1 (β=0.39, 95% CI 0.25-0.54, p<0.001), 1.60-fold increase in CEA (β=0.20, 0.05-0.35, p=0.008), and 3.58-fold increased CT abnormality risk (OR=3.58, p=0.023). Mediation analysis identified CYFRA21-1 as accounting for 69% (p=0.024) and CEA for 24.7% (p=0.036) of radon's effect on CT abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that occupational radon exposure contributes to pulmonary damage through both direct effects and biomarker-mediated pathways, with CYFRA21-1 and CEA emerging as potential early indicators of lung cancer in radon-exposed populations."

      "abstract": "RNA splicing dysregulation has emerged as a hallmark of cancer and a promising therapeutic target; however, its full landscape in human solid cancer remains poorly characterized. To address this, we perform alternative splicing analyses using RNA-sequencing data from 751 lung adenocarcinoma samples from our cohort integrated with 519 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Visualization of splicing patterns using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding reveals substantial inter-tumor heterogeneity driven by distinct molecular subtypes and histological differentiation. We identify a unique molecular subtype associated with inactivating mutations in CMTR2, which encodes Cap-specific mRNA (nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase 2. CMTR2 mutations are observed in 3.8% of cases and are predominantly truncating mutations, which form an isolated cluster within the splicing landscape. Intrinsic and CRISPR-Cas9-engineered CMTR2 mutations disrupt alternative splicing and sensitize cancer cells to sulfonamide-based RNA splicing modulators and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Retrospective patient data confirm the increased sensitivity of CMTR2-deficient tumors to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized RNA splicing deficiency in human cancers and define a molecular subtype of lung adenocarcinoma driven by RNA splicing dysregulation, suggesting targets for therapeutic intervention in lung cancer."

We describe participant characteristics, surgical outcomes, and EFS in surgically relevant subgroups.\n\nMETHODS: Participants with untreated, resectable, stage II‒IIIB (N2) NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, then surgery and adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for 13 cycles. Surgery was performed ≤20 weeks after first neoadjuvant dose (if 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy) or 4‒8 weeks after last neoadjuvant dose (1‒3 cycles); surgery beyond this was considered surgical delay. Adjuvant therapy began 4‒12 weeks after surgery. EFS was assessed in the surgical population.\n\nRESULTS: Of 397 participants randomized to pembrolizumab and 400 to placebo, 325 (82.1%) and 317 (79.4%), respectively, underwent surgery. At data cutoff (July 10, 2023), 4.9% (pembrolizumab) and 7.6% (placebo) of participants experienced surgical delay, 38.9% and 28.4%, respectively, experienced nodal downstaging, 78.8% and 75.1% underwent lobectomy, and 92.0% and 84.2% had R0 resections. Pembrolizumab improved EFS irrespective of disease stage, nodal status, and type of surgery versus chemotherapy. Eight participants (pembrolizumab, n=6; placebo, n=2) died ≤30 days after surgery from surgery-related adverse events.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab did not adversely affect surgical outcomes, was associated with numerically higher R0 resections, and improved EFS versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy in surgically relevant subgroups in early-stage NSCLC."

Trilaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor approved for myelopreservation in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Our results demonstrate that trilaciclib has antitumor potential in NSCLC without significant toxicity. It reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment by primarily increasing antitumor neutrophils and CD8"

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of longitudinal tumour dynamics, time-varying drug-related adverse events (DRAEs), and other clinical characteristics on long-term outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). An ambispective cohort of 277 patients was analysed and externally validated using independent clinical trial data from 470 patients in the Project Data Sphere. Individual tumour growth trajectories were characterised by predicted sum of the longest diameters (SLD) using tumour growth inhibition (TGI) modelling. Time-dependent Cox and parametric time-to-event models were then applied to evaluate the influence of predicted tumour growth trajectories, observed dynamic DRAE profiles, cross-sectional variables derived from these measures, and additional covariates on time-to-treatment failure (TTF) and progression-free survival (PFS). The TGI models effectively captured individual tumour dynamics. Across both Cox and parametric time-to-event models, prognostic factors consistently included DRAEs, baseline metastasis, EGFR-TKI treatment history, and the specific EGFR-TKI administered. Notably, grade 2 DRAEs were associated with an optimal balance between efficacy and safety, and this association remained robust in sensitivity analyses and was preliminarily validated using external data. These findings emphasise the clinical relevance of DRAE grades in indicating long-term clinical benefit. By linking manageable toxicity with durable therapeutic outcomes, the study provides valuable insights for developing safe and effective EGFR-TKI treatment strategies in patients with NSCLC."
