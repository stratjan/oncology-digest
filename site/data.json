      "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which commonly express FOLR2 or TREM2, are enriched in solid tumors and keep the tumor microenvironment (TME) immunosuppressed. Here, we introduce IL-12-expressing CAR-T cells targeting FOLR2 or TREM2 to deplete pro-tumor TAMs and reprogram the TME. Treatment with IL-12-armored anti-TAM CAR-T leads to significantly improved survival in metastatic ovarian and lung cancer models. The CAR-T mediates benefit at low cell dose and without lymphodepletion, and remains largely restricted to tumors with no overt toxicity. Spatial transcriptomics reveals that IL-12 anti-TAM CAR-T mediates sustained remodeling of the TME, even after CAR-T contraction, with the expansion of CXCL9+ immunostimulatory macrophages and endogenous tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells. Tumor clearance depends, in part, on FAS expression on cancer cells, revealing an IL-12-FAS axis for IL-12-armored CAR-T activity. These findings position IL-12-producing, myeloid-directed CAR-T as a broad strategy to remodel the TME and drive anti-tumor immunity for solid cancers."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Adjuvant immunotherapy is increasingly integrated into cancer care to reduce recurrence and improve survival. However, its high cost raises critical concerns regarding affordability and economic value across diverse health system contexts.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To synthesize published economic evaluations of adjuvant immunotherapy and assess cost-effectiveness outcomes, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)/life-year (LY) gains, and methodologic approaches.\n\nEVIDENCE REVIEW: A systematic search was conducted of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science for full economic evaluations published between January 1, 2015, and January 31, 2025. Eligible studies included cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses of adjuvant immunotherapy across any cancer type. Data were extracted on cancer type, treatment strategy (single vs combination therapy), treatment line, model structure, health utility instruments, funding sources, and cost-effectiveness outcomes. Methodologic quality was appraised using the Criteria for Health Economic Quality Evaluation 2023. Due to heterogeneity of health systems, findings were narratively synthesized.\n\nFINDINGS: The analysis included 69 studies covering a range of cancer types, most frequently non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. Of these, 46 (67%) evaluated first-line therapy with single-agent checkpoint inhibitors. Higher QALY/LY gains were consistently reported among the adjuvant immunotherapy group (63 [91%]), particularly for non-small cell lung cancer, industry-funded studies, and combination regimens. More than half of the evaluations (40 [58%]) concluded that adjuvant immunotherapy was cost-effective, although results varied by cancer type, model assumptions, drug pricing, funding organizations, and country-specific thresholds. Markov modeling was the dominant analytic approach (46 [67%]) and EuroQol 5 Dimensions was the most commonly used health utility instrument (56 [81%]).\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review found that adjuvant immunotherapy was frequently associated with meaningful QALY/LY improvements and was often considered cost-effective in high-risk or first-line settings. However, economic value remains context-specific, shaped by treatment strategy, drug costs, and modeling assumptions. These findings support the selective, value-based adoption of adjuvant immunotherapy and underscore the need for transparent, standardized economic evaluations to guide reimbursement and policy decisions."

RNK08954 is a potent and selective KRAS G12D inhibitor that inhibits proliferation of KRAS G12D-mutant cells and demonstrates significant tumor regressions in mouse xenograft models while inhibiting KRAS-mediated signaling. The in vivo effects of RNK08954 are explained by its unique pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and significantly prolonged retention time in tumor tissues. RNK08954 shows synergy with immune check blockade (ICB). In a Phase 1a study, the median follow-up was 4.85 months for 36 evaluable patients. In patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the objective response rate (ORR, unconfirmed) is 58.33%, and in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) the ORR (unconfirmed) was 33.33% in the 1000-1200mg cohort. This study supports the clinical potential of RNK08954 in patients with KRAS G12D mutation either as a single agent or in combination."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common type of lung cancer. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of LUAD in East Asia reported 28 independent susceptibility variants across 25 loci and identified 2 genes whose genetically predicted expression levels are associated with LUAD risk, using an ancestry-matched lung tissue expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) dataset. It is desirable to identify additional susceptibility loci and to understand their underlying biological mechanisms.\n\nMETHODS: Using an expanded GWAS of LUAD in East Asia and ancestry-matched lung tissue eQTL and DNA methylation QTL datasets, we performed transcriptome-wide association studies and DNA methylome-wide association studies simultaneously and examined the association between measured expression of genes and DNA methylation of nearby CpGs (eQTM). Genes and nearby CpGs are termed CpG-gene-LUAD trios if these three associations hold simultaneously.\n\nRESULTS: At Bonferroni-corrected P < .05, we identified a new susceptibility locus (6p21.31; lead SNP rs7772643), 10 LUAD-associated genes and 86 LUAD-associated CpGs. At false discovery rate q < 0.05, we identified 28 LUAD-associated genes, 220 LUAD-associated CpGs, and 45 CpG-gene-LUAD trios; among them, 43 were direction-matched regarding these three associations. These show that 23 of the known 28 susceptibility variants for LUAD in East Asia are near these genes or CpGs and MARCH3, ELF5, IKZF3, GSDMB, CCDC116, and DSP are putative novel susceptibility loci. Few of them was reported in LUAD in European populations.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study substantially advances our understanding of the etiology of LUAD in East Asia and could be useful in developing translational applications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, lung cancer management has been reshaped by advances in early detection, treatment, and prevention. Prevention now extends beyond tobacco control to include recognition of non-tobacco risk factors, screening, and incidental nodule programs. Yet progress in primary prevention remains uneven, with marked regional disparities. Smoking prevalence continues to decline and measures to reduce particulate matter exposure are expanding, but the overall global impact remains inconsistent.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: This article draws upon the discussions and expert recommendations presented at the New York Lung Cancer Foundation Summit 2025, integrating perspectives on prevention, screening, therapeutic innovation, and health system challenges across diverse health care settings.\n\nRESULTS: Screening programs, now active in >40 countries, achieve lower false-positive rates and earlier-stage diagnoses, although lung cancer incidence is rising among individuals who never used any tobacco products in some regions. Therapeutic innovations-including perioperative immunotherapy, targeted treatments for oncogene-driven non-small-cell lung cancer, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)-have markedly improved survival outcomes. Persistent challenges include refining patient selection, sequencing multimodal therapies, managing toxicity, and understanding mechanisms of resistance. Systemic barriers such as unequal progress in tobacco and vaping prevention, limited screening uptake, delayed molecular testing, and restricted access to multidisciplinary care continue to blunt these gains. Ongoing research on novel immunotherapies, ADCs, and bispecific antibodies aims to overcome therapeutic resistance. In small-cell lung cancer, consolidation immunotherapy and delta-like ligand 3-targeted approaches have improved outcomes and are redefining treatment paradigms. Persistent disparities in access and trial participation underscore the need for more equitable study designs, stronger international collaboration, and clearer communication with the public.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This article summarizes current advances and strategic priorities in lung cancer research and care, reflecting the discussions and recommendations of the New York Lung Cancer Foundation Summit 2025."

Furthermore, neoadjuvant immunotherapy is primarily suitable in the absence of specific genomic alterations. However, significant challenges remain, including suboptimal molecular testing and patients being assigned to non-optimal treatment strategies. Here, we present AI classifiers for the identification of EGFR, ALK, BRAF and MET alterations directly from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue using CanvOI 1.1, a digital pathology foundation model. Their performance was evaluated on an independent validation dataset of 968 NSCLC samples. The classifiers achieved AUCs of 0.87 for EGFR, 0.96 for ALK, 0.88 for BRAF and 0.83 for MET. Moreover, they demonstrated high accuracy in identifying cases lacking alterations. Our results highlight the potential of deep-learning tools for the detection of NSCLC biomarkers and specifically the identification of tumors without EGFR or ALK driver alterations, supporting more informed clinical decision-making."

      "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation is an incompletely characterized mechanism of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in EGFR-mutant cancers, limiting development of optimal treatment approaches. Through single-cell RNA sequencing of malignant pleural effusions from patients who underwent SCLC transformation, we identified heterogeneity and diversity, including distinct neuroendocrine (NE) and mesenchymal non-NE cancer cell subsets, which were maintained in patient-derived cell lines. We demonstrate that EZH2 regulates EGFR expression in NE cells where EGFR expression is silenced at baseline. Although neither epigenetic derepression nor exogenous overexpression of mutant EGFR sensitized the cells to EGFR inhibition, non-NE cells exhibited selective sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. Combined MEK inhibitor and chemotherapy effectively inhibited growth of both NE and non-NE cells in vitro and in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that EGFR-mutant SCLC is composed of mixed cell states with distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities and offer a therapeutic strategy to target tumor heterogeneity in highly plastic and treatment-resistant malignancies such as transformed SCLC."

This study evaluated the role of the APOBEC mutation signature in early-stage epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant NSCLC. This study aimed to assess the impact of APOBEC enrichment on recurrence-free survival (RFS), post-recurrence tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) progression-free survival (PFS), and post-recurrence survival (PRS).\n\nMETHODS: We conducted whole-exome sequencing and whole-transcriptome sequencing in 100 patients diagnosed with pathologic stage II-IIIA non-squamous NSCLC.\n\nRESULTS: Among the 100 patients, 18 (18 %) exhibited APOBEC (≥2) enrichment, which did not show a significant association with RFS (P = 0.14). Patients with APOBEC enrichment showed a shorter post-recurrence TKI PFS compared to those without APOBEC enrichment (8.13 months vs. 24.57 months, P = 0.017). In multivariate analysis, poor post-recurrence TKI PFS was associated with the type of EGFR mutation (L858R vs. exon 19 deletion, HR = 1.91, P = 0.04), TP53 mutation (HR = 2.07, P = 0.03), and APOBEC enrichment (≥2 vs. < 2, HR = 2.23, P = 0.02). PRS was 61.10 months and 21.77 months for patients with APOBEC enrichment and patients without APOBEC enrichment, respectively (P = 0.029). In multivariate analysis, poor PRS of EGFR-TKI was associated with the type of EGFR mutation (L858R vs. exon 19 deletion, HR = 2.29, P = 0.04) and APOBEC enrichment (≥2 vs. < 2, HR = 2.71, P = 0.02).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: APOBEC enrichment may present at initial diagnosis of early-stage EGFR mutant NSCLC and is associated with poor post-recurrence TKI PFS and PRS rather than RFS."

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and conference proceedings (to Oct 20, 2025) for phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS) and the incidence of grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs).\n\nRESULTS: Eleven RCTs (3,650 patients, seven regimens) were included. Compared to chemotherapy, sacituzumab tirumotecan (SacTMT), amivantamab plus chemotherapy (Chemo-Ami), and chemo-immunotherapy plus anti-angiogenic agent (Chemo-IO-anti-VEGF) demonstrated superior PFS (HR 0.49, 0.48, 0.53, respectively) and OS (HR 0.60, 0.73, 0.83, respectively). SacTMT also significantly improved OS over chemo-immunotherapy (HR 0.68, 95 % CrI 0.48 to 0.95). Regarding safety, Chemo-Ami carried higher grade ≥3 TRAEs risk (OR 2.83, 95 % CrI 1.01 to 7.90) versus chemotherapy, while SacTMT and Chemo-IO-anti-VEGF demonstrated toxicity comparable to chemotherapy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: SacTMT, Chemo-Ami, and Chemo-IO-anti-VEGF offer superior efficacy over chemotherapy for EGFR-mutant NSCLC after TKI progression. SacTMT and Chemo-IO-anti-VEGF may have more favorable safety profiles than Chemo-Ami. This comparative evidence helps to inform clinical decision-making."

This study aimed to evaluate postoperative outcomes in patients with UCM compared to those with common mutations (CM) using a large multicenter database.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 1,636 patients with EGFR-mutant LUAD who underwent complete resection between 2015 and 2018 at 21 Japanese institutions. Patients were classified into the CM and UCM groups. Recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS), and survival after recurrence (SAR) were analyzed using univariable and multivariable analyses and the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method.\n\nRESULTS: Among the patients, 1,441 (88.1%) had CM and 195 (11.9%) had UCM. RFS was comparable between the groups. However, patients with UCM showed significantly shorter OS and LCSS than those with CM (OS: multivariable hazard ratio [HR] 1.538, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.003-2.359; LCSS: multivariable HR 1.803, 95% CI 1.064-3.056). This trend was consistently validated using IPTW methods. SAR was also significantly shorter in patients with UCM. Subtype-specific analyses revealed that patients with exon 20 insertions (Ex20ins) had a significantly worse prognosis than those with other UCMs.\n\nCONCLUSION: Patients with UCM had significantly worse OS, LCSS, and SAR than those with CM despite similar RFS. These survival disadvantages in UCM were strongly associated with the Ex20ins subtype. These findings highlight the urgent need for novel perioperative treatments for patients with UCM, especially Ex20ins."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The Manchester Score, a prognostic model developed in 1987, was used to stratify patients with Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) by mortality risk, including stage, performance status, and three blood tests as risk factors. Many tools have since been developed for this purpose, but few have seen clinical use, with lack of robust external validation frequently cited as a barrier. In this study we apply a robust and pragmatic external validation approach to the Manchester Score to understand if it remains valid in an unselected modern patient cohort.\n\nMETHODS: SCLC patients treated in an academic centre between 2013 and 2022 (N = 1783) were included in the validation cohort. Discrimination was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves, AUC, and Harrell's C-index for the Manchester score and its underlying Cox model. Three levels of Cox model updating were used to address missing baseline hazard data: recalibration, recalibration with rescaling, and model refitting. Calibration was then evaluated with optimism adjustment at 6-, 12-, and 24-months post-diagnosis.\n\nRESULTS: The Manchester score shows good discrimination in the modern patient cohort. There is clear separation between risk groups in the Kaplan-Meier curves, with AUC = 0.75 and C-index = 0.68 for the Manchester Score and (AUC = 0.79, C-index = 0.70) for the underlying Cox model. Median survival in the 'good' prognostic group (meeting < 2/5 risk criteria) has increased compared to that from 1987. All model updating methods reported good calibration, with recalibration alone providing the best observed-to-expected ratio at 6 months (1.012 [0.978,1.045]).\n\nCONCLUSION: The original Manchester Score prognostic groups remain discriminative of survival, and when updated can predict survival probability at multiple timepoints."

Baseline and incident brain metastases were assessed, and their impact on mortality was quantified using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.\n\nRESULTS: Among 475 patients, 80 % received second-generation (n = 382) and 20 % received first-generation (n = 93) ALK TKIs. Baseline brain metastases were present among 32 % patients in second-generation cohort and 29 % in first-generation cohort. Among patients without baseline brain metastases, 5-year cumulative incidence of brain metastases during the follow-up period was 21 % in second-generation cohort and 25 % in first-generation cohort. In the second-generation cohort, patients who developed incident brain metastasis had a statistically significant 3-fold-higher risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 2.97 [95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.59-5.53]) compared to those who did not develop incident brain metastases. In the first-generation cohort, the risk of death was numerically higher for patients with incident brain metastasis compared to those without (HR, 1.42 [0.58-3.51]), although this was not statistically significant, likely limited by the small sample size. Baseline brain metastases, compared with no baseline brain metastases, were not associated with a significantly increased risk of death, after adjusting for incident brain metastasis and other covariates.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Brain metastases remains a clinically important concern in patients with ALK + mNSCLC treated with 1L ALK TKIs. Incident brain metastases were strongly associated with increased mortality, highlighting the need for CNS-penetrant 1L therapies with durable intracranial efficacy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In NSCLC, TP53 mutations are heterogeneous with varied effects on protein synthesis, function and clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that a refined classification of TP53 mutations, beyond binary categorization, could improve prognostication. Furthermore, specific mutations could be associated with enhanced benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) versus chemotherapy. To investigate this, we analyzed data from randomized trials (OAK and POPLAR) which compared atezolizumab to chemotherapy in previously treated advanced driver-negative NSCLC.\n\nMETHODS: Participants were classified as TP53 mutant or wild-type using baseline plasma, and by coding mutation, and Olivier's and Poeta's classification. We performed multivariable Cox regression analyses to evaluate the prognostic significance of TP53 mutations, and interaction tests to assess their predictive value.\n\nRESULTS: Among 762 participants, 49% harbored a TP53 mutation. TP53 mutations based on binary categorization were associated with poorer but not statistically significant OS compared to wild-type (adjusted-HR 1.15; 95 %CI 0.96-1.38; P = .12). However, nonsense mutations classified by coding mutations (adjusted-HR 1.71; 95% CI 1.22-2.39;P = .002), non-missense mutations classified by Olivier's classification (adjusted-HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.03-1.74; P = .03) and disruptive mutations classified by Poeta's classification (adjusted-HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.37-1.77; P = .03) were associated with statistically significant poorer OS. TP53 status did not predict differential benefit from ICI versus chemotherapy (interaction P = .45).\n\nCONCLUSION: In advanced driver-negative NSCLC following progression on first-line chemotherapy, nonsense, non-missense and disruptive mutations of TP53 were strongly associated with inferior OS. These data support utilizing a nuanced classification of TP53 mutations as a stratification factor in future trials, and laboratory reporting to aid prognostication."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the oncologic outcomes of sublobar resection (SLR) compared with lobectomy in patients with radiologically pure-solid stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 363 patients with clinical stage IA pure-solid NSCLC who underwent curative-intent resection between 2018 and 2020. Patients were divided into SLR (n = 60) and lobectomy (n = 303) groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), and Cox regression identified prognostic factors. Subgroup analyses were performed for stage IA2 and IA3 patients.\n\nRESULTS: In the overall cohort, the SLR group had significantly worse 5-year OS (75.5 % vs. 93.3 %, p < 0.01) and RFS (58.3 % vs. 77.4 %, p < 0.01) compared with lobectomy. In stage IA2, OS was comparable (87.2 % vs. 91.7 %, p = 0.1), but RFS was inferior after SLR (65.9 % vs. 81.2 %, p = 0.02). In stage IA3, both OS (54.3 % vs. 94.4 %, p < 0.01) and RFS (40.6 % vs. 74.9 %, p < 0.01) were markedly worse after SLR. Segmentectomy showed outcomes similar to lobectomy in IA2 but was inferior in IA3, whereas wedge resection was consistently associated with poor survival.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Lobectomy remains the standard surgical procedure for pure-solid stage IA NSCLC, particularly IA3 disease. Segmentectomy may be considered in carefully selected IA2 patients, while it is advisable to avoid wedge resection. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting the most appropriate patients for SLR and support the need for prospective validation."

      "abstract": "Currently, guidelines advise local radical treatment (LRT) to all disease sites in addition to systemic therapy in patients with synchronous oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the best order of treatments is unknown. This advice is largely based on expert opinion and on studies without immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), while an ICI-based regimen is now standard of care first-line treatment for stage IV NSCLC without an actionable genetic alteration (AGA). We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the order of treatments in patients with synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC without an AGA, with a single extrathoracic metastasis treated with an ICI-based regimen between 2018 and 2022. We evaluated upfront LRT to the metastasis followed by ICI and if indicated LRT to the local disease (Netherlands Cancer Registry: cohort 1, n = 225), and ICI followed by LRT to all disease sites if no progression (regional retrospective series: cohort 2, n = 33). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The median OS for cohort 1 and cohort 2 were 26 and 25 months, respectively, and 3-year OS rates of 45 % and 44 %, respectively. In cohort 1, better survival was seen for those with brain metastasis, good performance status, non-squamous histology and high PD-L1 expression. In cohort 2, better survival was seen for younger age and non-squamous histology. In conclusion, both upfront and delayed LRT combined with an ICI-based treatment can result in long-term survival in this patient population, however the most optimal sequence has yet to determined."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: PIK3CA mutations are oncogenic drivers in 2-4% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), often co-occurring with other drivers and conferring therapeutic resistance. This report is unique in describing the efficacy of the novel, highly selective PI3Kα inhibitor inavolisib in two heavily pre-treated patients with PIK3CA-mutant NSCLC harboring divergent co-drivers (EGFR and KRAS).\n\nCASE PRESENTATION: We present a 71-year-old male with EGFR/PIK3CA-mutant adenocarcinoma and brain metastases, and a 54-year-old female with KRAS/PIK3CA-mutant squamous cell carcinoma. Both patients reported rapid symptomatic improvement (hoarseness and shoulder pain, respectively) within two weeks of initiating inavolisib.\n\nDIAGNOSIS, INTERVENTION, AND OUTCOMES: Both patients received oral inavolisib (6 mg daily). Follow-up imaging after one month revealed significant tumor reduction. Notably, regressing intrapulmonary lesions exhibited tumor cavitation, and the male patient demonstrated a marked regression of central nervous system (CNS) metastases. The treatment was well-tolerated, with only Grade 1 oral mucositis reported.\n\nCONCLUSION: The primary take-away lesson is that selective PI3Kα inhibition with inavolisib can induce potent systemic and intracranial responses in PIK3CA-mutant NSCLC, regardless of the primary oncogenic co-driver. The observed tumor cavitation suggests a potential anti-angiogenic mechanism, warranting further investigation."

We describe participant characteristics, surgical outcomes, and EFS in surgically relevant subgroups.\n\nMETHODS: Participants with untreated, resectable, stage II-IIIB (N2) NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, then surgery and adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for 13 cycles. Surgery was performed ≤20 weeks after first neoadjuvant dose (if 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy) or 4-8 weeks after last neoadjuvant dose (1-3 cycles); surgery beyond this was considered surgical delay. Adjuvant therapy began 4-12 weeks after surgery. EFS was assessed in the surgical population.\n\nRESULTS: Of 397 participants randomized to pembrolizumab and 400 to placebo, 325 (82.1%) and 317 (79.4%), respectively, underwent surgery. At data cutoff (July 10, 2023), 4.9% (pembrolizumab) and 7.6% (placebo) of participants experienced surgical delay; 38.9% and 28.4%, respectively, experienced nodal downstaging; 78.8% and 75.1% underwent lobectomy; and 92.0% and 84.2% had R0 resections. Pembrolizumab improved EFS irrespective of disease stage, nodal status, and type of surgery vs chemotherapy. Eight participants (pembrolizumab, n = 6; placebo, n = 2) died ≤30 days after surgery from surgery-related adverse events.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab did not adversely affect surgical outcomes, was associated with numerically higher R0 resections, and improved EFS vs neoadjuvant chemotherapy in surgically relevant subgroups in early-stage NSCLC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Savolitinib combined with osimertinib is a potential novel therapy for patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring MET amplification after progression on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of savolitinib-osimertinib versus standard of care platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in this patient population.\n\nMETHODS: SACHI was a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial conducted across 68 Chinese hospitals. Eligible adults with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and MET amplification after EGFR TKI failure were randomly assigned (1:1) to once daily oral savolitinib-osimertinib or intravenous chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus either cisplatin or carboplatin), both in 21-day cycles. Central randomisation was implemented through an interactive web-response system with stratification based on the presence of brain metastases, previous exposure to third-generation EGFR TKIs, and EGFR mutation subtype, using a mixed block-size methodology. The primary endpoint, investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1, was tested using a hierarchical procedure: first in the third-generation EGFR TKI-naive population, and if positive, the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Safety analysis was performed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment. Interim analysis data cutoff was Aug 30, 2024. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05015608) and is complete.\n\nFINDINGS: Between Oct 15, 2021, and Aug 30, 2024, 211 patients were enrolled, 106 were randomly assigned to savolitinib-osimertinib and 105 were randomly assigned to chemotherapy, including 137 (65%) of 211 who were third-generation EGFR TKI-naive (69 in the savolitinib-osimertinib group; 68 in the chemotherapy group). In 106 patients in the savolitinib-osimertinib group, the median age was 59·4 years (IQR 54·3-65·8), 62 (58%) were female, and 44 (42%) were male. In 105 patients in the chemotherapy group, the median age was 61·9 years (IQR 56·3-69·1), 55 (52%) were female, and 50 (48%) were male. All participants were Asian. Median PFS was significantly prolonged with savolitinib-osimertinib versus chemotherapy in the third-generation EGFR TKI-naive (9·8 months [95% CI 6·9-12·5] vs 5·4 months [4·2-6·0]; hazard ratio 0·34 [0·21-0·56]; p<0·0001) and ITT populations (8·2 months [6·9-11·2] vs 4·5 months [3·0-5·4]; 0·34 [0·23-0·49]; p<0·0001). Grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in the same proportion of patients in both groups who received the study drugs (60 [57%] of 106 patients in the savolitinib-osimertinib group and 55 [57%] of 96 patients in the chemotherapy group).\n\nINTERPRETATION: The savolitinib-osimertinib combination improved PFS versus chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutation-positive, MET-amplified NSCLC that had progressed on EGFR TKI therapy, while maintaining a favourable tolerability profile. This regimen offers a potential oral treatment option for this biomarker-selected population.\n\nFUNDING: HUTCHMED and AstraZeneca."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Osimertinib has become standard of carein 1 LEGFR-mutated(mt)mNSCLC following the FLAURA trial.However, limited data are available on the effect of osimertinib dose-reductionon outcomes compared tofull-dose.\n\nMETHODS: We performed a single-institution, retrospective analysis of pts withEGFR-mt mNSCLC treated with 1 L osimertinib from 2018 to 2023. Pts who underwent dose-reduction were compared to thosemaintained on full dose (80 mg daily). Baseline demographics, disease characteristics, treatment history, toxicity, and clinical outcomes were abstracted from the electronic medical record and compared using independent sample t-tests and chi-square analyses as appropriate. Median progression free survival (mPFS), time to discontinuation (mTTD), and overall survival (mOS) were compared via Kaplan-Meier log-rank test and Cox regression analysis with time-varying covariate.\n\nRESULTS: Of 171 pts with mNSCLC treated with 1 L osimertinib, 26 (15%) required dose-reduction. Sex (p = 0.458), race (p = 0.421), ECOG PS > 1 at diagnosis (p = 0.730) and smoking history (p = 0.485) were comparable between reduced-dose and full-dose pts. 44% vs 34% of reduced dose and full dose pts, respectively, had CNS metastases at diagnosis (p = 0.192). All dose-reduced pts experienced adverse events (AEs), compared to 48% of full-dose pts (p < 0.001). Dose-reduced pts had shorter mPFS compared to full-dose pts (17.0 vs 24.6 mos; p = 0.043). Median PFS with dose-reduction was shorter compared to full-dose in pts with (p = 0.041) or without CNS metastases (p = 0.048). On time-variate, multivariable analysis, dose-reduction was associated with inferior PFS (p = 0.047) regardless of baseline characteristics. TTD was comparable in pts with and without dose-reduction (21.3 vs 25.2 mos; p = 0.521) OS was comparable in pts with and without dose-reduction (36.7vs 39.2 mos; p = 0.749). 14 pts (8%) discontinued osimertinib due to AEs, of whom 9 (64%) were previously dose-reduced. mPFS was comparable (p = 0.334) between pts who discontinued and those who did not, as was mOS (p = 0.910).\n\nCONCLUSION: Dose-reduction of osimertinib was relatively uncommon and associated with shorter PFS (primarilyCNS progression), but similar TTD and OS in 1 L patients withEGFR-mutated mNSCLC."
