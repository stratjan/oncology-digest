      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause for cancer related death worldwide. One treatment option for patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma is the targeted therapy gefitinib (Iressa®, ZD1839). As with other promising targeted therapies, desired in vivo effects of gefitinib came short to in vitro expectations, as preclinical testing is hampered by an inaccuracy of existing models and resistances develop frequently. We analysed the pharmacodynamics of gefitinib in a 3D tissue engineered human lung cancer model of HCC827 cells, as well as a resistant subpopulation of HCCres A2 cells. In 2D cell culture, a cell viability of 50 % was reached after treatment with 0.01-0.05 μM gefitinib. In the 3D model administering higher doses of gefitinib did not lead to a further reduction in viability and proliferation, or an increase in apoptosis. This shows that the pharmacodynamic effect of promising new therapies can often be overestimated in 2D versus 3D models. The results we obtained for gefitinib testing in the 3D models reflect astonishing well the efficacy of priorly published clinical data, suggesting that our 3D tumor models can display in vivo conditions more accurately, bridging the gap to living organisms. To mimic the clinical setting further, the lung cancer cells were cultivated under dynamic conditions in a bioreactor. The exploration of a resistant subpopulation confirmed an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The described 3D lung cancer model can be used as a refined, preclinical testing platform for targeted therapies and with clinically relevant pharmacodynamic properties as shown exemplary for gefitinib."

      "abstract": "The objective of this research is to investigate the association between occupational radon exposure and pulmonary health outcomes in male miners from Chongqing, China. Between June 2022 and December 2023, 110 miners were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Personal radon exposure levels were measured using passive cumulative dosimeters, with pulmonary health assessed through radiologist-interpreted low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans and serum biomarker analysis (CEA, CYFRA21-1, NSE, and CA125) via ELISA. Multivariable analyses revealed strong dose-response relationships between radon exposure and both serum biomarkers and CT abnormalities. high radon exposure predicted substantial biomarker elevations including a 2.45-fold increase in CYFRA21-1 (β = 0.39, 95 % CI 0.25-0.54, p < 0.001), 1.60-fold increase in CEA (β = 0.20, 0.05-0.35, p = 0.008), and 3.58-fold increased CT abnormality risk (OR = 3.58, p = 0.023). Mediation analysis identified CYFRA21-1 as accounting for 69 % (p = 0.024) and CEA for 24.7 % (p = 0.036) of radon's effect on CT abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that occupational radon exposure contributes to pulmonary damage through both direct effects and biomarker-mediated pathways, with CYFRA21-1 and CEA emerging as potential early indicators of lung cancer in radon-exposed populations."

      "abstract": "The phase II PHAROS study previously showed that encorafenib plus binimetinib has antitumor activity in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC). In PHAROS, 98 patients (59 treatment-naïve; 39 previously treated) received encorafenib 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily. We report updated results from data cutoff of March 14, 2025. The median duration of treatment with both encorafenib and binimetinib was 16.3 months in treatment-naïve and 5.5 months in previously treated patients. After median follow-up for overall survival (OS) of 52.3 months in treatment-naïve patients, mOS was 47.6 months (95% CI, 31.3 to not estimable); 4-year OS probability was 49% (95% CI, 35 to 62). After median follow-up for OS of 48.2 months in previously treated patients, mOS was 22.7 months (95% CI, 14.1 to 32.6); 4-year OS probability was 31% (95% CI, 16 to 47). In treatment-naïve and previously treated groups, 58% and 26% received ≥1 subsequent systemic anticancer treatment, respectively. Safety profile remained consistent with that in previous analyses. Although comparisons across trials should be done cautiously, to our knowledge, encorafenib plus binimetinib was associated with the longest mOS reported to date with targeted treatment in patients with treatment-naïve BRAF V600E-mutant mNSCLC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anti-PD-L1 antibodies with platinum-etoposide extend overall survival (OS) of extensive disease Small Cell Lung Cancer (ED-SCLC) patients. We evaluated the benefit of first-line pembrolizumab with platinum-etoposide in chemo-sensitive ED-SCLC.\n\nMETHODS: REACTION is a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II trial. Eligible patients (responders after 2 cycles of platinum-etoposide) were randomized 1:1 to experimental arm pembrolizumab in combination with 4 cycles of platinum-etoposide then pembrolizumab vs platinum-etoposide in the control arm. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) were enumerated and their association with PFS and OS was investigated.\n\nRESULTS: Between Feb 7, 2018 and Oct 31, 2019, 125 patients were recruited (61 vs 64 experimental and control arms respectively) with 119 (58 vs 61) eligible and receiving at least one dose of treatment. Baseline characteristics were median age 65 vs 63.5 years, PS 1 (62 vs 60 %), and brain metastases (8 vs 11 %), in the experimental and control arms respectively. Amongst 124 patients who started treatment, 46 (37 %) experienced adverse events grade ≥ 3 for pembrolizumab arm vs 26 % in the control arm. Response rate was 61 % (67 vs 56 %). Median PFS (95 % CI) was 4.7 months (4.2, 5.6) vs 5.4 (4.7, 5.6), HR (80 % CI) = 0.84 (0.65, 1.09) and 1-sided p = 0.194. Median OS (95 % CI) was 12.3 months (8.9, 14.8) vs 10.4 (8.2, 12.2), HR (80 % CI) = 0.73 (0.54, 1.0) and 1-sided p = 0.097. CTC count per 7.5 ml blood at randomization was associated significantly with both PFS and OS regardless of treatment arms.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab added to platinum-etoposide did not improve PFS over platinum-etoposide alone in chemo-sensitive patients with ED."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) represents a potentially fatal but preventable postoperative complication. We sought to establish and validate an explainable prediction model based on the machine learning (ML) approach for VTE, and assess its prognostic implications in thoracic oncology patients undergoing VATS Segmentectomy.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively developed and validated a predictive model for postoperative VTE following VATS segmentectomy. Patients were sequentially enrolled into training (n = 557, Apr.2017-Jan.2021) and validation cohorts (n = 239, Feb.2021-Oct.2022). 49 clinicopathological variables, including the novel biomarker von Willebrand factor A2 (vWF-A2), were evaluated. 11 ML algorithms were compared based on several evaluation indexes including AUC. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was utilized for feature ranking and interpretability. The final model was benchmarked against the traditional Caprini score, and the prognostic impact of postoperative VTE on long-term survival was further assessed.\n\nRESULTS: In this prospective study, eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) demonstrated superior discriminative performance among 11 evaluated ML-models. After feature reduction based on ranked feature importance, a final interpretable XGBoost model comprising 11 variables was established. This model accurately predicted postoperative VTE in both training (AUC = 0.903) and validation (AUC = 0.856) cohorts, significantly outperforming the conventional Caprini score RAM. Additionally, comparison of oncologic outcomes revealed no significant difference in overall survival (P = 0.068), whereas disease-free survival was significantly shorter in patients experiencing postoperative VTE (P = 0.017).\n\nCONCLUSION: Our explainable risk-stratification ML model not only accurately predicts the risk of VTE following VATS segmentectomy in early-stage NSCLC patients, but also exhibits substantial clinical relevance to adverse prognostic outcomes in this patient cohort."

      "abstract": "The phase 3 IMpower150 trial in treatment-naïve patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrates significantly longer progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with first-line atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1)-bevacizumab (anti-VEGF)-carboplatin-paclitaxel (ABCP) than with bevacizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel (BCP). We characterise four molecular NSCLC subtypes identified by unsupervised clustering of transcriptomes of 564 pre-treatment primary tumour samples from IMpower150 using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF1-4). Each subtype has distinct tumour PD-L1 expression levels, epithelial characteristics, immune composition, and treatment outcomes. Both NMF2 (enriched in tumour proliferation signal, macrophages, and monocytes) and NMF4 (enriched in B cells and T cells) have elevated tumour PD-L1 expression. Of these two, only NMF4 demonstrates PFS and OS benefits with ABCP versus either BCP or atezolizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel (ACP). Patients with NMF1 (enriched in basal and squamous-like cells) have improved outcomes on ABCP compared with ACP or BCP; those with NMF3 (enriched in adenocarcinoma signatures) show similar outcomes among treatments. These insights could help inform individualised first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC."
