      "abstract": "Unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibits substantial heterogeneity and complexity. The landmark LAURA and POLESTAR studies have established a standard therapeutic model involving targeted consolidation therapy with osimertinib or aumolertinib after definitive chemoradiotherapy for NSCLC patients harboring EGFR-sensitive mutations. However, treatment strategies for patients with other driver gene mutations (e.g., ALK fusions, ROS1 rearrangement) still lack robust support from high-level evidence-based medical study. To enhance the standardization of diagnosis and treatment for unresectable stage III driver-positive NSCLC patients, the Radiotherapy Committee of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology convened an expert working group. This group identified common clinical practice issues and conducted an in-depth, problem-oriented analysis of domestic and international guidelines alongside evidence-based medical data. Through multiple rounds of comprehensive discussion and expert voting, this consensus was jointly developed. It provides evidence-based recommendations addressing frequently encountered clinical questions regarding unresectable stage III driver-positive NSCLC, aiming to serve as a key reference for clinical practice."

      "abstract": "This study investigates the variability of radiomic features in longitudinal CT scans from a multi-institutional NSCLC cohort and introduces a harmonization pipeline to improve predictive modeling of immunotherapy response. Baseline and follow-up CT scans from NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents were analyzed, with two institutions combined for model training and internal testing, and a third institution serving as an external test set. To address variability from imaging parameters-such as scanner manufacturer, slice thickness, and noise-we applied image harmonization followed by feature harmonization using NestedComBat. This approach substantially reduced feature dependence on acquisition confounders (from 78.8% to 12.8%) and improved feature robustness across institutions. We further assessed the temporal consistency of radiomic features across longitudinal scans using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Image harmonization yielded the largest gains in stability (mean ΔICC = +0.021, p < 0.001), while the combined approach also enhanced longitudinal reliability (ΔICC = +0.014, p < 0.001). Finally, harmonization improved predictive performance for 6-month immunotherapy response, increasing the AUC from 0.695 to 0.768 in the internal test and from 0.692 to 0.802 in the external test. These results demonstrate that combining image- and feature-level harmonization enhances the robustness and temporal consistency of radiomic features, potentially supporting more reliable and generalizable predictive modeling across diverse datasets and clinical settings."

To inform clinical decision-making, we report real-world (rw) treatment patterns and outcomes in Chinese patients with unresectable stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC who underwent chemoradiotherapy.\n\nMETHODS: Data were retrospectively extracted from the China Multicentre Lung Cancer Precision Medicine Registry medical records of adults with unresectable stage III EGFR-mutated (exon 19 deletion [Ex19del]/leucine-to-arginine substitution at position 858 [L858R]) NSCLC (diagnosed Jan 2016-Dec 2019) who received standard-of-care chemoradiotherapy. The primary outcome was rw progression-free survival (rwPFS) and secondary outcomes were mutation testing patterns, treatment sequencing post-diagnosis, and rw time-to-next treatment or death (rwTTNTD).\n\nRESULTS: Of 51 patients, 65%/33% had Ex19del/L858R mutations. As first treatment, 31 patients (61%) received chemoradiotherapy plus EGFR-TKI (mainly first-generation) and 20 (39%) chemoradiotherapy alone. Of 34 (67%) patients who received first-subsequent treatment, most were given EGFR-TKI (88%). In patients who received chemoradiotherapy plus EGFR-TKIs (first-generation) or chemoradiotherapy alone, median (95% confidence interval) rwPFS/rwTTNTD was 22.6 (14.2-34.6)/25.0 (21.5-44.7) or 12.2 (10.5-not estimable)/13.6 (10.5-not estimable) months, respectively.\n\nCONCLUSION: These rw results show that while first-generation EGFR-TKIs are associated with numerically longer rwPFS and rwTTNTD relative to chemoradiotherapy alone in Chinese patients with unresectable stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC, there remains an unmet need to prolong survival."

In the global Phase 3 PAPILLON trial, amivantamab plus carboplatin-pemetrexed (amivantamab-chemotherapy) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) vs chemotherapy alone in previously untreated participants with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertions (Ex20ins). We evaluated clinical outcomes in Asian participants in PAPILLON (NCT04538664).\n\nMETHODS: Participants were randomized 1:1 to amivantamab-chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Study endpoints for this analysis were PFS by blinded independent central review (primary), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), PFS after first subsequent therapy (PFS2), overall survival (OS), and safety (secondary). Crossover to amivantamab monotherapy was allowed when disease progressed on chemotherapy alone.\n\nRESULTS: Among 186 participants in the Asian sub-cohort, 97 received amivantamab-chemotherapy and 89 received chemotherapy. At median follow-up of 16.6 months, median PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) in the amivantamab-chemotherapy/chemotherapy groups was 11.5/5.6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.34; 95%CI, 0.23-0.49; nominal p < 0.0001) arms. The ORR was 70% vs 51% (odds ratio 2.2, 95%CI, 1.2-3.9; nominal p = 0.012), DoR 10.1 vs 5.5 months. Median PFS2 was not estimable vs 18.8 months (HR 0.46, 95%CI 0.26-0.83; nominal p = 0.008), and median interim OS not estimable vs 24.4 months HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.34-1.24; nominal p = 0.189), respectively, despite substantial (73%) crossover. Safety profiles for both arms were similar to the overall PAPILLON population.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Amivantamab-chemotherapy demonstrated superior PFS vs chemotherapy and represents a new standard of care for first-line treatment of Asian participants with Ex20ins-mutated NSCLC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amivantamab, a bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and MET, is increasingly used in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Dermatologic and mucosal adverse events are highly prevalent and often more severe and clinically complex than with conventional EGFR inhibitors, frequently challenging treatment continuation. However, structured management guidelines for amivantamab-associated toxicities are currently lacking.\n\nMETHODS: An international panel of dermatologists with expertise in oncodermatology and members of the EADV Task Force \"Dermatology for Cancer Patients\" conducted a structured review of clinical trial data, emerging real-world evidence, and existing toxicity management frameworks. Key clinical challenges were identified through iterative expert discussions, and consensus was achieved through repeated rounds of manuscript review and refinement. Pragmatic grading systems and stepwise management algorithms were developed.\n\nRESULTS: We propose comprehensive strategies for prevention and monitoring and provide toxicity-specific management algorithms for acneiform eruption, erosive pustular dermatosis (EPD)-like scalp reactions, paronychia, anogenital ulcerations, and mucositis. For EPD-like scalp eruptions and anogenital ulcerations, where validated grading systems are lacking, we introduce pragmatic severity-based grading frameworks. Emphasis is placed on early recognition, individualized supportive care, appropriate use of systemic therapies, and timely treatment modification to minimize unnecessary interruptions while ensuring patient safety.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Amivantamab is associated with a distinctive and clinically impactful toxicity profile that frequently complicates routine management. These consensus-based recommendations provide thoracic oncologists with practical tools to support early intervention, optimized supportive care, and rational treatment adaptation, potentially improving quality of life, reducing avoidable treatment interruptions, and supporting sustained oncologic benefit."

This study aimed to identify clinical, pathological, and inflammatory-immune predictors of recurrence, early recurrence, and brain metastasis after curative resection in young patients.\n\nMETHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included 224 consecutive patients aged <50 years who underwent anatomical lung resection between 2015 and 2024 at five Italian centers. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was analyzed using Fine-Gray competing-risk regression and overall survival (OS) using Cox proportional hazards models. Early recurrence was defined as occurring within 12 months after surgery. The prognostic value of preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), PD-L1 expression, and their combined phenotypes was explored. An exploratory ROC-derived NLR cut-off of 2.35 was used for stratification.\n\nRESULTS: During follow-up, 65 patients (29.0%) experienced recurrence, with brain metastases representing the most frequent distant site (10.3% overall). Early recurrence occurred in 11.6% of patients. On multivariable analysis, higher NLR independently predicted recurrence (sHR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.73), mortality (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.27-2.61), and early recurrence (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.07-12.21). PD-L1 expression alone was not prognostic; however, when combined with NLR, it identified inflammatory-immunologic phenotypes with different risks of brain metastasis among patients who recurred (p = 0.051).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Young-onset NSCLC is characterized by a high burden of early and distant recurrence, particularly involving the brain. Preoperative NLR is a robust predictor of recurrence, early relapse, and mortality. Combined NLR-PD-L1 phenotypes identify a subgroup at increased risk of neurotropic relapse."

Ex20ins-mutated NSCLC can be resistant to most approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The Phase III PAPILLON trial (NCT04538664) demonstrated that amivantamab plus chemotherapy significantly improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chemotherapy alone, leading to its approval as a first-line treatment for patients with Ex20ins NSCLC. PAPILLON further evaluated patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and time to symptomatic progression (TTSP).\n\nMETHODS: The open-label, multicenter trial randomized 308 treatment-naïve patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring Ex20ins to receive either amivantamab plus carboplatin-pemetrexed (n = 154) or chemotherapy alone (n = 154). TTSP was defined as the time to onset or worsening of lung cancer-related symptoms necessitating treatment change or clinical intervention, or death. PROs were assessed using the PROMIS PF8c and EORTC QLQ-C30.\n\nRESULTS: At 12 months, 77 % of patients in the amivantamab-chemotherapy arm remained free of symptomatic progression versus 60 % in the chemotherapy arm (HR, 0.67; 95 % CI, 0.46-0.98; p = 0.04). Physical functioning and global health status PROs were maintained in both arms, with a higher proportion of patients treated in the amivantamab-chemotherapy arm reporting stable or improved quality of life at 6 and 12 months.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Amivantamab plus chemotherapy significantly delays symptomatic progression without compromising health-related quality of life, reinforcing its role as a first-line treatment for Ex20ins-mutated NSCLC."

Although clinical trials have not reported significant gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), we describe two real-world cases (representing 8% of 25 treated patients) who developed life-threatening GIB during therapy. Both patients exhibited progressive hypoalbuminemia and gastrointestinal mucosal edema preceding the onset of bleeding. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and endoscopic evaluation demonstrated diffuse bowel wall edema and multiple mucosal ulcers. Both the patients received apixaban. One patient recovered with supportive management, while the other died of hemorrhagic shock. These findings suggest that real-world patients, who are often older, treated in later lines of therapy, and using concomitant anticoagulants, may be more vulnerable to severe gastrointestinal complications than those enrolled in controlled clinical trials. Close monitoring of serum albumin levels and gastrointestinal symptoms is recommended to prevent potentially fatal complications."

Survival analyses,including Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression, were employed to assess disease-free survival (DFS) and identify independent prognostic indicators.\n\nRESULTS: The analysis included 78 participants with a median follow-up time of 38.5 months (95% CI: 28.4 - 48.6). The median DFS was 72.8 months (95% CI: 44.7 - 100.8). Univariate analysis revealed significant associations between DFS and several clinical (T stage, overall clinical stage, and CYFRA21-1), PET (SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak, TLG, and MTV), and pathological (Ki-67 index, tumor spread through air spaces [STAS], and pleural invasion) factors (p < 0.05, for all). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the following independent predictors of DFS: SUVmax (HR = 16.152, p = 0.002), STAS (HR = 6.122, p = 0.040), T stage (HR = 2.588, p = 0.049), and preoperative CYFRA21-1(HR = 6.509, p = 0.028).\n\nCONCLUSION: The assessment of"

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) rearranged non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) develop bypass resistance mechanisms that activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling. We conducted a study to evaluate the ALK/ROS1 inhibitor lorlatinib combined with MAPK pathway inhibitors: binimetinib (MEK inhibitor) or TNO155 (SHP2 inhibitor).\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: This phase IB study employed a 3 + 3 design. Patients who had disease progression on ALK or ROS1 inhibitors received lorlatinib (50 mg or 75 mg daily) with binimetinib (30 mg or 45 mg BID) or TNO155 (40 mg or 50 mg daily). The primary objective of phase 1 was determining the recommended phase 2 dose for the combinations. The primary objective of the phase 2 portion was determining the objective response rate (ORR) of each combination. Secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability and progression-free survival.\n\nRESULTS: In this phase IB clinical trial, 17 patients received lorlatinib and binimetinib; two patients received lorlatinib with TNO155. All patients with ALK + NSCLC had received prior lorlatinib. Among 15 evaluable patients in the lorlatinib-binimetinib cohort, one (6.7%) had a partial response (duration of response: 114 days), eight (53.3%) had stable disease, and six (40%) experienced primary progression. Median progression-free survival on lorlatinib-binimetinib was 51 days (95% CI 39-107). Treatment-related adverse events associated with lorlatinib-binimetinib were primarily grade 1-2, including rash (65%), edema (47%), and lipid abnormalities (47%). One patient discontinued treatment for grade 2 retinopathy. In the lorlatinib-TNO155 arm, both patients stopped treatment due to rapid disease progression and pleural effusions, limiting efficacy evaluation. The study was terminated due to slow accrual before advancing to the phase 2 component.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Regimens co-targeting the MAPK pathway and ALK or ROS1 had limited efficacy in unselected patients with lorlatinib-resistant NSCLC, underscoring the need for more effective and biomarker-informed treatment strategies."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Concerns persist regarding the psychological effects of low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening, with prior studies linking it to psychological distress and diminished quality of life (QoL). However, specific risk factors remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the psychological features of LDCT recipients with the general population and identify associated factors.\n\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using prospectively collected data from April 2022 to April 2023. Participants seeking second opinions at a tertiary medical center in Asia after LDCT screenings were recruited. We collected sociodemographic data, screening details, and self-administered questionnaires assessing somatic symptoms, health anxiety, depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Psychological conditions and QoL were compared between LDCT recipients and a general population cohort comprising 3161 individuals.\n\nRESULTS: We compared 201 LDCT recipients (30.8% male, mean age 56.6 years) with 3161 general population controls. Compared to the general population (adjusted for age and sex), LDCT recipients had significantly higher rates of somatic symptom disorder (28.9% vs. 5.0%, p < 0.001), depression (16.4% vs. 5.7%, p < 0.001), and anxiety (20.9% vs. 3.5%, p < 0.001). Among 103 participants undergoing surgical intervention, 85.4% were diagnosed with malignant or precancerous lesions. The 3-year overall survival rate was 98.0%, indicating favorable clinical outcomes.\n\nCONCLUSION: LDCT recipients in an Asian population exhibited a higher prevalence of psychological distress than the general population. Close monitoring is essential, especially among those with pre-existing mental health issues. Future longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate long-term psychological outcomes of LDCT screening."

We quantified immune cell densities, nuclear pleomorphism features, and clinical variables, and trained four machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors) to predict overall survival.\n\nRESULTS: Clinical parameters consistently demonstrated the strongest performance in predicting long and short-term survival (logistic regression mean accuracy 0.60 ± 0.01, AUC 0.66 ± 0.01). The addition of immune cell densities revealed a small, statistically significant improvement in survival prediction (accuracy 0.62 ± 0.01, p < 0.01, AUC 0.67 ± 0.01, p = 0.04), while nuclear pleomorphism features did not improve prediction. When combined with clinical parameters, immune cell densities also improved survival stratification in Cox regression analyses numerically (HR = 0.51 vs. 0.55 for clinical parameters alone). Model interpretation analyses showed that stage and performance status have the largest effect on model performance. Selected immune cell densities (tumor CD4-helper and stroma B-cells) have a limited but consistent effect.\n\nCONCLUSION: Clinical parameters remain the dominant predictors of outcome in NSCLC, with immune cell densities providing only limited prognostic value for clinical stratification. The openly available code and datasets present a unique resource for method development or focused analysis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The 5-year recurrence rate remains significantly high (∼30 %) in patients with early-stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), even after complete tumor resection. Recurrence prediction primarily relies on pathological assessment and genomic abnormalities. However, proteins - the functional executors of genetic information - may offer additional prognostic value. In this study, we aimed to develop a model integrating proteomic and clinical features to improve recurrence prediction in early-stage NSCLC.\n\nMETHODS: We recruited 351 stage Ⅰ NSCLC patients who underwent radical surgery in discovery corhort. An additional 103 participants from external prospective cohort were used for validation. Clinical data and follow-up outcomes were retrospectively collected. Tumor proteomics profiling was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The proteomics data were acquired using a data-independent acquisition mode with a 150-minute gradient method and analyzed against the human UniProt database using DIA-NN (v1.8.1). We assessed the association between proteomic and clinicopathologic factors and disease-free survival (DFS) using Cox proportional hazards regression. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to construct the predictive model.\n\nRESULTS: Of the 351 patients analyzed, 4260 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified as being associated with tumor recurrence. A nine-protein prediction model outperformed the clinicopathologic-based model (AUC, 0.898 vs. 0.742; P < 0.001) in predicting DFS. A combined model incorporating nine proteins and clinicopathological features demonstrated excellent predictive value for 5-year recurrence in the discovery cohort (AUC = 0.896). Nine proteins combined with clinicopathological features showed an AUC of 0.810 in the external validation cohort and an AUC of 0.844 in the combined cohort.\n\nCONCLUSION: Integrating tumor proteomics with clinicopathologic features enhances risk stratification and improves recurrence prediction after surgical resection of early-stage NSCLC. This approach may enable more personalized postoperative management through refined surveillance intervals and potential adjuvant therapies."

Pts who underwent dose-reduction were compared to thosemaintained on full dose (80 mg daily). Baseline demographics, disease characteristics, treatment history, toxicity, and clinical outcomes were abstracted from the electronic medical record and compared using independent sample t-tests and chi-square analyses as appropriate. Median progression free survival (mPFS), time to discontinuation (mTTD), and overall survival (mOS) were compared via Kaplan-Meier log-rank test and Cox regression analysis with time-varying covariate.\n\nRESULTS: Of 171 pts with mNSCLC treated with 1 L osimertinib, 26 (15%) required dose-reduction. Sex (p = 0.458), race (p = 0.421), ECOG PS > 1 at diagnosis (p = 0.730) and smoking history (p = 0.485) were comparable between reduced-dose and full-dose pts. 44% vs 34% of reduced dose and full dose pts, respectively, had CNS metastases at diagnosis (p = 0.192). All dose-reduced pts experienced adverse events (AEs), compared to 48% of full-dose pts (p < 0.001). Dose-reduced pts had shorter mPFS compared to full-dose pts (17.0 vs 24.6 mos; p = 0.043). Median PFS with dose-reduction was shorter compared to full-dose in pts with (p = 0.041) or without CNS metastases (p = 0.048). On time-variate, multivariable analysis, dose-reduction was associated with inferior PFS (p = 0.047) regardless of baseline characteristics. TTD was comparable in pts with and without dose-reduction (21.3 vs 25.2 mos; p = 0.521) OS was comparable in pts with and without dose-reduction (36.7vs 39.2 mos; p = 0.749). 14 pts (8%) discontinued osimertinib due to AEs, of whom 9 (64%) were previously dose-reduced. mPFS was comparable (p = 0.334) between pts who discontinued and those who did not, as was mOS (p = 0.910).\n\nCONCLUSION: Dose-reduction of osimertinib was relatively uncommon and associated with shorter PFS (primarilyCNS progression), but similar TTD and OS in 1 L patients withEGFR-mutated mNSCLC."

Cone-beam CT (CBCT) may enhance tool-to-lesion alignment and diagnostic yield (DY), but the benefit of integrating mobile CBCT (mCBCT) into the Monarch\n\nMETHODS: This single-center retrospective study examined adults undergoing RAB biopsy for PPLs (May 2019-March 2023), applying a strict DY definition. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were evaluated in Monarch and Monarch plus mCBCT groups.\n\nRESULTS: Of 331 cases, 179 used Monarch and 152 used Monarch plus mCBCT. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics. DY was not different (70.9 % in Monarch vs 71.7 % in Monarch plus mCBCT, p = 0.976) nor were complication rates (7.3 % in Monarch vs. 3.9 % in Monarch plus mCBCT, p = 0.291). In the Monarch group, the procedure duration was longer (77 min in Monarch vs. 69 min in Monarch plus mCBCT, p = 0.002) and the radiation dose was lower (7.4 mGy in Monarch vs. 285.9 mGy in Monarch plus mCBCT, p < 0.001). Adjusted analysis demonstrated that mCBCT was not associated with improved DY (OR [95 % CI]: 1.33[0.78-2.28]) or reduced risk for complications (OR [95 % CI]: 0.41 [0.13; 1.14]). DY increased with larger nodule size but not with lesion location.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Evaluating outcomes across two sequential practice eras, the addition of mCBCT to Monarch RAB did not significantly improve DY or reduce complications but reduced procedure duration at the cost of increased radiation exposure.\n\nSUMMARY: - Evaluated diagnostic performance of Monarch™ vs. Monarch™ + mobile Cone-beam CT (mCBCT). - Diagnostic yield and complication rates were similar. - The mCBCT group had shorter procedure times and about 40-fold higher radiation doses.\n\nCONFERENCE PRESENTATION: The study findings have been presented in American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology Annual Conference in 2024.

      "abstract": "Lung cancer (LC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Compared to men, LC in women presents distinct epidemiologic, biological, and clinical characteristics. A large proportion of LC cases in women occur in never-smokers, underscoring the important roles of environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility, and hormonal influences in disease pathogenesis. LC in women also displays unique molecular profiles, with a higher prevalence of actionable alterations such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, which inform targeted therapy selection. Despite advances in chemotherapy, targeted agents, and immunotherapy, sex-based differences in treatment efficacy, toxicity, and survivorship persist and remain incompletely understood. Additional barriers, including limited access to LC screening and the underrepresentation of women in clinical trials, further constrain the application of evidence-based interventions for women. This review synthesizes latest evidence on epidemiology, risk factors, molecular features, screening, treatment outcomes, and survivorship challenges in women with LC with a deep focus on novel approaches to overcome current barriers and disparities to improve prevention, early detection, treatment, and long-term survivorship care."

Nevertheless, recurrence remains a concern even in Stage IA, for which adjuvant osimertinib is not indicated. We evaluated the utility of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to predict recurrence in patients with resected pStage I-III EGFR-mutated NSCLC and examined prognostic value of preoperative biomarkers and pathological features.\n\nMETHODS: Between January 2017 and May 2020, 382 patients with lung tumors underwent surgery at Kanazawa University Hospital, including 88 with NSCLC harboring common EGFR mutations. Preoperative ctDNA was analyzed using droplet digital PCR, targeting EGFR mutations. Patients were followed for up to 6.4 years, and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.\n\nRESULTS: Preoperative ctDNA positivity was detected in 26.1 % and venous invasion in 39.8 %. ctDNA-positive patients had lower 60-month DFS (54.1 % vs. 84.1 %; HR = 3.25; 95 % CI, 1.13-9.21; p = 0.028) and 60-month OS (65.1 % vs. 95.9 %; HR = 6.10; 95 % CI, 1.11-33.46; p = 0.037). Venous invasion was independently associated with poorer DFS (HR = 8.73; 95 % CI, 1.81-41.93; p = 0.0068). In combined analyses, no recurrences occurred in the double-negative, whereas the double-positive had a lower 60-month DFS than the single-positive (HR = 3.61; 95 % CI, 1.19-10.93; p = 0.023).\n\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative ctDNA detection and pathological venous invasion provide complementary prognostic information, and venous invasion is an independent predictor of recurrence risk in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Combined assessment may refine postoperative risk stratification and inform perioperative management."

Patients were included if they had cytologically or radiologically confirmed LM and prior EGFR-TKI exposure. Clinical data, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profiles (cytology, biochemistry, molecular features), and treatment details were collected. Local therapies included WBRT (30-37.5 Gy in 10-15 fractions) and IT pemetrexed via Ommaya reservoir (10-20 mg weekly for 4 weeks, then bi-weekly for 2 months, followed by monthly maintenance). Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. A prognostic nomogram was developed and validated.\n\nRESULTS: Among 200 included patients, the median OS was 12.3 months (95% CI: 10.8-13.8). Patients receiving local therapy (n = 149) had longer OS than those without (n = 51) (13.1 vs. 8.8 months; HR = 0.78, p = 0.001). The combination of IT and WBRT was associated with the best survival outcome (median OS 18.5 months). In CSF analysis, the initial cytology positivity rate was 74.4% (128/172), and normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and chloride levels were associated with longer OS (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified ECOG score, prior third-generation TKI, third-generation TKI plus anti-angiogenic therapy, and local therapy as independent prognostic factors.\n\nCONCLUSION: The combination of IT via Ommaya reservoir and WBRT may result in better survival in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with LM and represents a promising treatment strategy for this patient population."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: KRAS is a common driver gene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Owing to the absence of universally effective targeted agents and marked heterogeneity, optimal treatment selection for KRAS-mutant NSCLC remains uncertain. This study combined network meta-analysis (NMA) with real-world evidence to inform precision treatment strategies.\n\nMETHODS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials were included in a Bayesian NMA to compare efficacy outcomes across regimens in KRAS-mutant and KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC. In parallel, real-world data from advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC patients treated at our center were analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Across KRAS and G12C NMAs, immunotherapy-based regimens generally outperformed chemotherapy-based regimens. PD-(L)1 inhibitors monotherapy ranked highest for overall survival (OS), while chemotherapy plus PD-(L)1 inhibitors and anti-angiogenic therapy (anti-VEGF) ranked highest for progression-free survival (PFS). Chemotherapy plus dual immune checkpoint blockade (PD-(L)1 and CTLA-4) yielded a greater improvement in OS than in PFS. In our real-world cohort, first-line PD-(L)1 monotherapy achieved the best outcomes (objective response rate: 88.9%; median PFS: 22.2 months), followed by chemotherapy plus PD-(L)1 ± anti-VEGF. On multivariable analysis, ECOG performance status 0-1, PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50%, TMB ≥ 10 mut/Mb, and chemotherapy plus PD-(L)1 ± anti-VEGF were independently associated with longer first-line PFS. In subsequent lines, G12C inhibitors significantly improved outcomes versus other therapies, whereas non-G12C disease derived limited benefit from available strategies.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Immunotherapy constitutes the cornerstone of first-line therapy for KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Within this framework, PD-(L)1 monotherapy may be appropriate for carefully selected patients with high PD-L1 expression, whereas chemoimmunotherapy can extend benefit to broader subgroups; escalation with anti-VEGF or anti-CTLA-4 agents appears clinically promising and merits biomarker-driven prospective evaluation. KRAS G12C inhibitors are effective in later lines, while treatment options for non-G12C disease remain limited."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and extrapulmonary neuroendocrine (NE) tumors are aggressive malignancies with limited treatment options. Seizure-related homolog 6 (SEZ6) is a potential therapeutic target, but its expression in these tumors remains poorly understood. Lineage plasticity contributes to resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where some cases can undergo SCLC-transformation after targeted therapy. We aimed to characterize SEZ6 expression across NE tumors and presumed NSCLC-to-SCLC transformations.\n\nMETHODS: DNA and RNA sequencing were performed for SCLC, NSCLC, and NE samples. Samples were stratified by SEZ6 RNA expression quartiles and classified into subtypes based on ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 expression. Significance was tested using the Mann-Whitney U test. Real-world overall survival was obtained from insurance claims data, with p-values calculated using the log-rank test. Paired samples for NSCLC-to-SCLC transformation were identified by sequential biopsies classified as NSCLC followed by SCLC.\n\nRESULTS: RNA sequencing was performed on 1318 SCLC and 2218 NE samples. Median SEZ6expression was higher in SCLC (39.7 transcripts per million (TPM)) than in NE tumors (20.8 TPM, p<0.0001) and NSCLC (1.34 TPM, p<0.001). Among NE tumors, median SEZ6 expression was highest in prostate (52.0 TPM, p=0.0016 vs SCLC) and lowest in adrenal gland tumors (1.2 TPM, p<0.0001 vs SCLC). In SCLC,SEZ6expression was positively correlated with ASCL1(p=0.44, p<0.0001) andNEUROD1(p=0.16, p<0.0001) expression but notPOU2F3(p=-0.04, p=0.1253). Median survival was longest in SEZ6-Q2 for both SCLC and NE (13.0 mos. and 33.7 mos., respectively). NSCLC-to-SCLC transformation samples showed numerically higher SEZ6 expression post-transformation (median: 86.2 vs 2.4 TPM).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: SEZ6expression is higher in SCLC than in NE tumors, with notable heterogeneity by subtype, warranting consideration of expanded use of SEZ6-directed therapy. Translational Relevance Statement: This study establishes SEZ6 as a promising therapeutic target in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and transformed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), demonstrating its significantly elevated expression compared to neuroendocrine (NE) tumors and NSCLC. The positive correlation of SEZ6 expression with NE lineage markers, particularly in ASCL1 and NEUROD1 subtypes, highlights its role as a lineage-specific marker, guiding the development of SEZ6-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Additionally, the increased SEZ6 expression following NSCLC-to-SCLC transformation suggests that SEZ6-targeted therapies could address resistance mechanisms in transformed tumors. Importantly, the association between high SEZ6 expression and shorter survival indicates that integrating SEZ6 status into diagnostic workflows could help stratify patients by risk and guide therapeutic decision-making. The findings from this study will inform future clinical trials, aiming to implement SEZ6-targeted treatments as part of precision oncology strategies for aggressive NE malignancies."

The first-in-human phase I study (NCT05055232) enrolled patients with advanced NSCLC harboring ALK or ROS1 rearrangements. Participants received 50-600 mg/day dirozalkib following a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design with rapid titration, and 300-600 mg/day in the dose-expansion phase. The primary endpoint was safety.\n\nRESULTS: Dirozalkib demonstrated potent inhibition of ALK fusion-positive cell lines and common resistance mutations, and suppressed tumor growth in patient-derived and intracranial xenograft lung cancer models. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred, establishing 600 mg/day as the maximum tolerated dose. Among 114 patients enrolled, 55 (48.2 %) experienced grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events, most commonly diarrhea (8.8 %). The objective response rate (ORR) among patients with ALK rearrangements was 47.4 % (9/19) and 46.3 % (38/82) in the dose-escalation and dose-expansion cohort (89.3 % in ALK inhibitor-naive patients receiving 500 mg/day).

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Perioperative chemoimmunotherapy is the standard of care for resectable, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although pathologic complete response (pCR) correlates with excellent survival outcomes, some patients without pCR still exhibit long-term survival. In this study, we evaluate the added value of minimal residual disease (MRD).\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MRD was assessed in 60 patients from the NADIM II trial (NCT03838159) using the Guardant Reveal assay. In NADIM II, patients with NSCLC without EGFR or ALK alterations were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy (experimental arm) or chemotherapy alone, followed by surgery. Patients in the experimental arm with R0 resection received adjuvant nivolumab.\n\nRESULTS: The MRD detection rate was 9.6%. MRD after surgery or during adjuvant treatment was associated with inferior event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival [OS; hazard ratio (HR): 10.2; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.7-28.3 and HR: 10.0; 95% CI, 2.0-49.9, respectively]. All patients with MRD-negative plasma samples in at least two time points were alive [HR: not estimable (NE), P < 0.001], with only one relapse (HR: 41.6; 95% CI, 5.0-348.8), corresponding to a patient relapsing with a single brain metastasis. MRD enhanced the prognostic value of pCR for both EFS (P < 0.001) and OS (P = 0.015). Among non-pCR patients, MRD remained a significant prognostic marker (HR: 6.2; 95% CI, 2.2-17.1 and HR: 6.5; 95% CI, 1.3-32.5, for EFS and OS respectively). All non-pCR patients with MRD-negative results in at least two time points were alive (HR: NE, P = 0.025), with one relapse (HR: 19.9; 95% CI, 2.4-165.6), corresponding to the aforementioned case.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: MRD may refine prognostic evaluation beyond pCR in resectable NSCLC undergoing perioperative chemoimmunotherapy."

We examined the association of Medicaid expansion and (1) early-stage diagnosis (I and II); (2) timely initiation of guideline-concordant treatment within 30 days after diagnosis; (3) receipt of all first-course guideline-concordant treatment; and (4) 5-year OS. We applied conventional and updated (Sun and Abraham) difference-in-differences (DID) approaches to examine the changes in study outcomes associated with Medicaid expansion using multivariable linear probability models to estimate stage and treatment and multivariable flexible parametric survival models to investigate survival overall and by key factors.\n\nRESULTS: Compared with people in nonexpansion states (n = 164,228), people in expansion states (n = 350,290) were more likely to be female, non-Hispanic White, or living in areas with higher family income or in nonmetropolitan areas. Medicaid expansion was associated with increases in early-stage NSCLC diagnosis (DID: 1.02 percentage points [ppt; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.52]), timely treatment initiation (2.10 ppt [95% CI, 0.05 to 4.15]), and higher 5-year OS (1.79 ppt [95% CI, 1.32 to 2.26]). In stratified analyses, people living in areas with lower household income were more likely to benefit from Medicaid expansion.\n\nCONCLUSION: Medicaid expansion was associated with improvements in early detection, timeliness of guideline-concordant treatment, and survival for people with NSCLC. Anticipated Medicaid coverage losses may jeopardize these gains."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Carers of people living with breathlessness face common challenges due to the chronic, distressing and unpredictable nature of the symptom. These include unmet information and support needs resulting in worsened health and psychosocial outcomes. This review aimed to (1) identify the relative volume of studies on supportive interventions for carers of people living with breathlessness due to different respiratory diseases, (2) characterize the nature of the interventions, and (3) explore their reported effectiveness on outcomes identified by carers as being important.\n\nMETHODS: Medline and CINAHL were searched for studies reporting interventions targeting unpaid adult carers of people with breathlessness, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILD) published 2000-2025. Intervention characteristics and reported outcomes were extracted and compared across diagnoses and intervention categories. Our findings were shaped by consultation with unpaid carers in a series of patient and public involvement workshops.\n\nRESULTS: From 72 included interventions, three approaches were identified: Education, therapeutic support, and interventions for patient management. Interventions for lung cancer carers most frequently offered therapeutic support to the carer, while those for COPD carers most frequently focused on managing the patient. COPD and ILD carers have been underserved by research. We found few therapeutic support interventions for COPD carers. Reporting of carer demographics was poor, including among RCTs.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: There was a dominance of research focusing on carers of people with lung cancer (56% of participants). In PPI consultations, carers identified stigma and poor communication with health providers as factors contributing to the disparity between lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. More research is needed to compare the efficacy of different intervention strategies to improve outcomes that matter most to carers. To improve equity, researchers must consistently report carer demographics and prioritize developing interventions for carers underserved by research."
