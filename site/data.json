      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite an initial favorable response of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to osimertinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), resistance to this drug inevitably develops. Whereas genetic mechanisms for such acquired resistance have been identified, the molecular mediators of resistance induction have remained unclear.\n\nMETHODS: To identify factors that mediate induction of osimertinib resistance, we studied clinical samples from individuals with EGFR-mutant NSCLC as well as cell lines including PC-9 and H1975. Methods adopted included transcriptomics analysis and immunohistochemistry of pretreatment NSCLC specimens, spatial transcriptomics analysis, a cell viability assay, immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR analysis, RNA sequencing, immunoblot analysis, comprehensive proteomics analysis by mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, and a mouse xenograft tumor model.\n\nRESULTS: Transcriptomics analysis of pretreatment clinical specimens identified IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3) as a gene specifically upregulated in patients with a poor response to osimertinib treatment. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that patients with IFITM3-positive tumors experienced a shorter progression-free survival on osimertinib treatment. Spatial transcriptomics and other analyses further revealed that IFITM3 expression in tumor cells was increased in response to cytokines derived from the tumor microenvironment (TME) during osimertinib treatment. IFITM3 was found to promote the development of osimertinib resistance in NSCLC cell lines through interaction with MET and activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, combined treatment with a MET inhibitor suppressed the development of osimertinib resistance in a mouse xenograft tumor model.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that upregulation of IFITM3 driven by TME cytokines represents a previously unrecognized mechanism of osimertinib resistance, and they suggest that targeting of the IFITM3-MET axis may improve EGFR-TKI treatment outcome for EGFR-mutant NSCLC."

      "abstract": "Indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) are increasingly detected due to rising health awareness and widespread lung cancer screening, yet distinguishing benign from malignant nodules remains a critical challenge. Emerging evidence suggests that recognizing cancer-associated immune signatures represents a powerful approach for early-stage cancer detection. This study explored the clinical utility of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis in IPN evaluation. By conducting large-scale TCR sequencing (6,059 blood and 988 tumor samples), we established LungTCR (https://www.lungtcr.com/), a comprehensive TCR repertoire database and proposed a method for quantitative assessment of tumor-related immune responses. LungTCR was leveraged to develop TCRnodseek plus, a diagnostic model integrating clinical data, CT imaging, and TCR features. A multi-center prospective study (ChiCTR2200055761) involving 1,107 IPN patients validated the superior diagnostic performance of TCRnodseek plus over existing approaches. Mechanistic analyses revealed that the identified lung cancer-related TCR clones are enriched in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and predominantly present in malignant nodules and tumor tissues. This study provides a robust TCR database and an advanced diagnostic model, offering a framework for precise IPN differentiation."

      "abstract": "The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer (LC) screening trial (Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek [NELSON]) demonstrated low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduces LC mortality by 24% among men. The NELSON protocol differed from previous trials in the eligibility criteria, the use of volume-based nodule management, and increasing screening intervals. The early-stage sensitivity of the protocol is pivotal in determining the optimal screening strategy, such as the interval and age range. The MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis-Lung natural history model was used to reproduce LC incidence and mortality by detection method (clinical or screen-detected), sex, histology, and stage in the NELSON trial based on individual-level data. We evaluated screening effectiveness by stage and histology, accounting for population characteristics, trial design, and LC epidemiology. We find stage IA non-small cell LC (NSCLC) sensitivity of 24.6% (other NSCLC) to 41.0% (adenocarcinoma) at baseline screening. At repeat screening rounds, we find this increased to 70.9% for stage IA adenocarcinoma. For stage IB, the sensitivity by histology ranges from 26.4% to 77.1%; for stage II, 39.6%-81.9%. Upon detection, the probability of LC mortality prevention is estimated at 83% for stage IA. The sensitivity for detecting early-stage LC is found to depend on the histology of cancer and is increased for adenocarcinoma at repeat screenings. Despite a low rate of referral to follow-up screening in the NELSON trial, early-stage CT sensitivity and the probability of mortality prevention were similar to previous estimates from the National Lung cancer Screening Trial. Previously demonstrated screening effectiveness may be maintained when implementing new programs, while reducing unnecessary follow-up when considering NELSON evidence."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: EGFR-mutated (EGFRm) NSCLC is associated with high incidence of brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease (LMD), for which effective systemic options beyond osimertinib 80 and 160 mg daily are limited. While there is some evidence for high-dose pulse administration of earlier-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFK-TKIs), data for pulse-dose osimertinib are limited.\n\nMETHODS: This multicenter retrospective case series included patients with EGFRm NSCLC with LMD or parenchymal brain metastases treated with pulse-dose osimertinib (400-560 mg once every 5-7 days) for central nervous system (CNS) progression, with or without other concurrent therapies. CNS disease control was defined as the interval from pulse-dose osimertinib initiation to radiographic progression or discontinuation for clinical progression, whichever was shorter.\n\nRESULTS: Among 14 patients, EGFR mutations included exon 19 deletion in 6, L858R in 6, and other mutations in 4. All had received previous EGFR-TKI including 5 with prior osimertinib 160 mg daily. Seven received pulse-dose osimertinib as monotherapy, while the remainder received it in combination with other systemic therapy and/or CNS radiation. No treatment-related severe or unexpected side effects were reported, and only 1 patient required dose modification for adverse events. Median duration of CNS control was 4.0 months (95% CI, 1.8-NR) and median overall survival was 6.2 months (95% CI, 3.2-NR), with benefit driven by patients without previous osimertinib 160 mg daily exposure.\n\nCONCLUSION: Though further pharmacokinetic investigation is warranted, this report provides preliminary evidence that pulse-dose osimertinib may be a safe regimen among patients with EGFRm NSCLC and refractory CNS disease."

Aim of this analysis is to provide end-of-study results from the phase IIIb MAURIS study on the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in the same disease setting, in a patient population with broader inclusion criteria.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: MAURIS is a multicentric, open-label, single-arm study conducted between 2019 and 2023 in 25 Italian study centres. A total of 155 patients with untreated ES-SCLC were enrolled. Treatment was based on atezolizumab 1200 mg + carboplatin + etoposide every 21 days, for 4 to 6 cycles, during the induction phase, and atezolizumab every 3 weeks during the maintenance phase. Safety, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were among study endpoints.\n\nRESULTS: The median OS at end of study was 10.6 months, with OS rates of 45.5% at 1 year, 31.0% at 1.5 years, 17.1% at 2 years and 14.5% at 3 years. The median PFS was 5.5 months. Serious adverse events (AEs) occurred in 38.3% of patients, treatment-related serious AEs in 21.4%, and immuno-mediated treatment-emergent AEs in 26.6% of patients. Immune-mediated grade 3 to 4 AEs were inversely related with mortality (hazard ratio, HR = 0.36; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.13-0.97) in a multivariate analysis.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study showed consistent findings with the IMpower133 trial on the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. Long-term survival of a subgroup of patients was also confirmed."

The aim of this study is to provide an up-to-date analysis on toxicities and outcomes associated with definitive radiation therapy (RT) in patients with ILD and early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC).\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception until June 2024, for studies including patients with ILD who underwent definitive RT alone for ES-NSCLC. Data including treatment-related mortality, toxicity, local control, and overall survival were collected and analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Of 3545 records reviewed, 24 studies were identified for full data abstraction, contributing a total of 705 patients. A specific ILD subtype was not reported for 71% (n = 502) of patients. ILD severity was not reported for 62% (n = 440) of patients. Risk of treatment-related mortality was 7.9%, with severe treatment-related respiratory toxicity 15.7%. A higher volume of lung receiving ≥5 Gy (V5) was significantly correlated with mortality. The estimated local control at 3 year was 76% and median overall survival was 2.5 years.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The relative merits of RT for the treatment of ES-NSCLC in patients with ILD should be considered in the context of the rates of treatment-related mortality and toxicity. Future studies would benefit from consistent reporting of ILD characteristics, which may help in risk stratification in this challenging clinical scenario."

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of longitudinal tumour dynamics, time-varying drug-related adverse events (DRAEs), and other clinical characteristics on long-term outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). An ambispective cohort of 277 patients was analysed and externally validated using independent clinical trial data from 470 patients in the Project Data Sphere. Individual tumour growth trajectories were characterised by predicted sum of the longest diameters (SLD) using tumour growth inhibition (TGI) modelling. Time-dependent Cox and parametric time-to-event models were then applied to evaluate the influence of predicted tumour growth trajectories, observed dynamic DRAE profiles, cross-sectional variables derived from these measures, and additional covariates on time-to-treatment failure (TTF) and progression-free survival (PFS). The TGI models effectively captured individual tumour dynamics. Across both Cox and parametric time-to-event models, prognostic factors consistently included DRAEs, baseline metastasis, EGFR-TKI treatment history, and the specific EGFR-TKI administered. Notably, grade 2 DRAEs were associated with an optimal balance between efficacy and safety, and this association remained robust in sensitivity analyses and was preliminarily validated using external data. These findings emphasise the clinical relevance of DRAE grades in indicating long-term clinical benefit. By linking manageable toxicity with durable therapeutic outcomes, the study provides valuable insights for developing safe and effective EGFR-TKI treatment strategies in patients with NSCLC."

      "abstract": "The treatment landscape of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has evolved considerably with the integration of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) into first-line regimens. However, the majority of patients will ultimately have primary resistance or develop secondary resistance, driven by a complex interplay of intrinsic tumour biology and adaptive changes within the tumour microenvironment (TME), which can be further amplified by host-related factors such as dysbiosis and organ-specific conditions. Despite these heterogeneous origins, most mechanisms of resistance to ICIs lead to an immunosuppressive TME as the final common pathway. Consequently, current strategies designed to overcome resistance aim to restore antitumour immunity via antibody-based therapies (including bispecific antibodies, T cell engagers and antibody-drug conjugates), targeted therapies, adoptive cell therapies, therapeutic vaccines or intratumoural immunotherapies. Although substantial progress has been made in identifying potential biomarkers associated with immune resistance, the clinical relevance of many of these observations remains limited. Biomarker-driven studies using adaptive, hypothesis-generating designs might offer a promising path forward by navigating the complexity of resistance and enabling the timely evaluation of novel therapeutic concepts. In this Review, we summarize the latest advances in addressing resistance to ICIs in patients with advanced-stage NSCLC and provide insights into emerging clinical strategies and future research directions."

      "abstract": "Although the involvement of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) in metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis has been previously described, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, the starting material for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In a companion study by Zhang et al., we demonstrated that PLK1 phosphorylation of PDHA1 at threonine 57 (PDHA1-T57) drives its protein degradation via mitophagy activation. Using a stable-isotope resolved metabolomics (SIRM) approach, we now show that PLK1 phosphorylation of PDHA1-T57 results in metabolic reprogramming from OXPHOS to glycolysis. Notably, cells mimicking PDHA1-T57 phosphorylation rely more on the aspartate-malate shuttle than on glucose-derived pyruvate to sustain the TCA cycle. This metabolic shift was also observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and transgenic mice conditionally expressing the PDHA1-T57D variant, highlighting the role of PLK1 in metabolic reprogramming in vivo. It is well-established that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-mediated phosphorylation of PDH leads to its inactivation and that dichloroacetic acid (DCA), a PDK inhibitor, has been investigated in preclinical and early clinical studies as a potential therapeutic agent for lung cancer. We demonstrated that DCA combined with Onvansertib, a PLK1 inhibitor, synergistically inhibits lung tumor growth by enhancing mitochondrial ROS, inhibiting glycolysis, and inducing apoptosis. This study aims to elucidate how PLK1-associated activity drives the metabolic reprogramming from OXPHOS to glycolysis during cellular transformation, thereby contributing to lung carcinogenesis. Our results provide support for a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of Onvansertib plus DCA in treating lung cancer."

Over a median follow-up of 37.8 months, amivantamab-lazertinib led to significantly longer overall survival than osimertinib (hazard ratio for death, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.92; P = 0.005); 3-year overall survival was 60% and 51%, respectively. At the clinical cutoff date, 38% of participants in the amivantamab-lazertinib group and 28% in the osimertinib group were still receiving the assigned treatment. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were more common with amivantamab-lazertinib (in 80% of participants) than with osimertinib (in 52%), particularly skin-related events, venous thromboembolism, and infusion-related events; these findings were consistent with the established safety profile of each treatment.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy has improved pathological complete response (pCR) rates and event-free survival in resectable NSCLC, yet its efficacy in SMARCA4-altered NSCLC, a subset associated with poor prognosis, remains unclear.\n\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical characteristic and next-generation sequencing of 29 SMARCA4-altered NSCLC patients with neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy from Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) were classification by SMARCA4 condition by WXS and was further analyzed the difference between two group. In altered group, BostonGene molecular functional portraits was used for tumor environment classification.\n\nRESULTS: 29 SMARCA4-altered NSCLC patients recevied neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy, the objective response rate was 70.4% and the pCR rate was 51.7%. The pCR rate significantly differed among pathological subgroups (squamous cell carcinoma vs adenocarcinoma, 83.3% vs. 28.6%, p = 0.045). After a median follow-up of 17 months, 7 patients relapsed and 1 died from non-cancer causes. SMARCA4 alterations were associated with early progression (42.8%) with a median event-free survival of 13 months, although some patients achieved durable survival. All patients harboring co-occurring KRAS with KEAP1/STK11 mutations relapsed. TCGA data showed SMARCA4-altered LUAD had worse survival (34.8 vs. 50.9 months, p = 0.033), downregulation innate immunity, and enrichment of mTOR/MYC signaling. Immune classification revealed both immune-desert and immune-enriched subtypes within the altered cohort. The lacking immune cell infiltration group showed significantly shorter overall survival compared to immune-enriched subtypes (28.8 vs. 49.9 months, p = 0.043).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, SMARCA4-altered NSCLC is heterogeneous. SCC demonstrates remarkable sensitivity with immunochemotherapy, while non-SCC, especially with KRAS+KEAP1/STK11 co-mutations, represents a distinct, immune-cold, high-risk subtype."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: NSCLC with mutations of the KRAS or EGFR gene is associated with a high risk of brain metastases (BRA). There are few data on the prevalence and pattern of BRA and on survival in unselected KRAS or EGFR patients.\n\nMETHODS: This real-world analysis (KOMPASS-study) included 326 NSCLC patients with stage IV adenocarcinoma and either KRAS mutation (n = 90), EGFR mutation (n = 87), or no known driver mutation (n = 149). Prevalence, number, and size of BRA, and the effect of BRA on overall survival (OS) were analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: The prevalence of BRA was higher in KRAS patients (40 %) or EGFR patients (39 %) than in no-driver patients (27 %). KRAS patients and no-driver patients significantly more often had single BRA, whereas EGFR patients had multiple BRA (median number 1, 2, and 4, respectively). The presence of BRA did not adversely affect OS in KRAS patients (22.3 vs. 19.2 months, HR 0.91) and no-driver patients (8.9 vs. 10.9 months, HR 0.99). EGFR patients with BRA had inferior OS (20.5 vs. 35.5 months, HR 2.70, p = 0.0004). Patients with single BRA had improved OS (22.3 vs. 13.2 months, p = 0.013).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The lack of a negative effect of BRA on OS in KRAS patients or no-driver patients may be due to the frequent finding of a single BRA amenable to ablative treatment. The negative effect of BRA on OS in EGFR patients points to a distinct biology of EGFR-mutated NSCLC leading to a characteristic radiological pattern of multiple BRA which are not amenable to ablative treatment."
