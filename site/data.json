      "abstract": "The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer (LC) screening trial (Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek [NELSON]) demonstrated low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduces LC mortality by 24% among men. The NELSON protocol differed from previous trials in the eligibility criteria, the use of volume-based nodule management, and increasing screening intervals. The early-stage sensitivity of the protocol is pivotal in determining the optimal screening strategy, such as the interval and age range. The MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis-Lung natural history model was used to reproduce LC incidence and mortality by detection method (clinical or screen-detected), sex, histology, and stage in the NELSON trial based on individual-level data. We evaluated screening effectiveness by stage and histology, accounting for population characteristics, trial design, and LC epidemiology. We find stage IA non-small cellÂ LC (NSCLC) sensitivity of 24.6% (other NSCLC) to 41.0% (adenocarcinoma) at baseline screening. At repeat screening rounds, we find this increased to 70.9% for stage IA adenocarcinoma. For stage IB, the sensitivity by histology ranges from 26.4% to 77.1%; for stage II, 39.6%-81.9%. Upon detection, the probability of LC mortality prevention is estimated at 83% for stage IA. The sensitivity for detecting early-stage LC is found to depend on the histology of cancer and is increased for adenocarcinoma at repeat screenings. Despite a low rate of referral to follow-up screening in the NELSON trial, early-stage CT sensitivity and the probability of mortality prevention were similar to previous estimates from the National Lung cancer Screening Trial. Previously demonstrated screening effectiveness may be maintained when implementing new programs, while reducing unnecessary follow-up when considering NELSON evidence."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During unplanned respiratory-related hospitalizations, gradual improvement in physiological variables and reduced dependence on treatment are crucial for discharge decisions, possibly supported by discharge care bundles designed to reduce post-hospitalization readmission and mortality. However, patients prioritize symptom relief. This study tested the hypothesis that a significant proportion of patients admitted to a pulmonology ward for an acute respiratory episode experience dyspnea on the day of discharge. It further aimed to describe this dyspnea in a multidimensional manner.\n\nMETHODS: This 10-week prospective study was conducted at a single center and included patients admitted for acute respiratory conditions such as COPD or asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or pleural disease, who, on admission, reported a rating of 3 or higher on the \"immediate breathing discomfort\" item of the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP-A1). Dyspnea was assessed both at admission and at discharge using a multidimensional recall-based tool (MDP) and an instant unidimensional tool, the 10-cm visual analog scale (D-VAS).\n\nRESULTS: Seventy consecutive patients were included in the study. Although dyspnea ratings showed a statistically significant decrease during the hospital stay, dyspnea remained both frequent and intense at discharge. At discharge, 84% of patients provided MDP-A1 recall ratings above 0, with 70% rating their MDP-A1 at 3 or more. In contrast, only 22% provided D-VAS instant ratings of 3 or higher. The median MDP-A1 score was 4.0 [2.0-6.0]. \"Air hunger\" was the most frequently selected sensory descriptor.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Persistent dyspnea remains frequent and intense among patients being discharged after an acute respiratory episode."

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of longitudinal tumour dynamics, time-varying drug-related adverse events (DRAEs), and other clinical characteristics on long-term outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). An ambispective cohort of 277 patients was analysed and externally validated using independent clinical trial data from 470 patients in the Project Data Sphere. Individual tumour growth trajectories were characterised by predicted sum of the longest diameters (SLD) using tumour growth inhibition (TGI) modelling. Time-dependent Cox and parametric time-to-event models were then applied to evaluate the influence of predicted tumour growth trajectories, observed dynamic DRAE profiles, cross-sectional variables derived from these measures, and additional covariates on time-to-treatment failure (TTF) and progression-free survival (PFS). The TGI models effectively captured individual tumour dynamics. Across both Cox and parametric time-to-event models, prognostic factors consistently included DRAEs, baseline metastasis, EGFR-TKI treatment history, and the specific EGFR-TKI administered. Notably, grade 2 DRAEs were associated with an optimal balance between efficacy and safety, and this association remained robust in sensitivity analyses and was preliminarily validated using external data. These findings emphasise the clinical relevance of DRAE grades in indicating long-term clinical benefit. By linking manageable toxicity with durable therapeutic outcomes, the study provides valuable insights for developing safe and effective EGFR-TKI treatment strategies in patients with NSCLC."

There have been no prospective studies targeting TTF-1-negative nonsquamous NSCLC.\n\nMETHODS: This multicenter, single-arm phase 2 study enrolled chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve individuals with TTF-1-negative advanced nonsquamous NSCLC to receive four cycles of atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel, followed by atezolizumab alone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nRESULTS: Between June 2022 and March 2024, 52 patients (41 male and 11 female) with a median age of 68.0 years were enrolled. Thirty-three patients had adenocarcinoma and 19 had nonadenocarcinoma. Nineteen, 30, and 3 patients were current, former, and never-smokers, respectively. The PD-L1 tumor proportion score was <â¯1â¯% in 22 cases, 1-49â¯% in 18 cases, â¥â¯50â¯% in 11 cases, and unknown in 1 case. The median PFS was 4.9 months (80â¯% confidence interval [CI], 4.3-5.9 months). The lower limit of the 80â¯% CI did not exceed the prespecified threshold of 4.5 months; therefore, the study did not meet its primary endpoint. The median overall survival was 13.2 months (95â¯% CI, 10.3-27.2 months). The response rate was 56.9â¯% (95â¯% CI, 43.3-69.5â¯%). There were no new safety signals.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This first prospective study of individuals with TTF-1-negative advanced nonsquamous NSCLC has provided evidence for the efficacy and safety of the combination of carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel with atezolizumab in such patients. The prognosis of TTF-1-negative advanced nonsquamous NSCLC remains poor, however, warranting further treatment development."

According to the guideline of the European Society of Thoracic Surgery, invasive staging should be performed in selected patients. The outcome of invasive staging with video-assisted mediastinoscopic lymphadenectomy in patients with potentially respectable non-small cell lung cancer is evaluated in this study.\n\nMETHODS: Patients who underwent invasive mediastinal staging by video-assisted mediastinoscopic lymphadenectomy between 2008 and 2019 received retrospective single-centre analysis. Patients were divided into two groups: one group met the guideline criteria for invasive staging, whereas the other group did not.\n\nRESULTS: 1640 patients were included in the study, 374 (22.8%) of whom had mediastinal lymph node metastases. N2 and N3 status were detected in 300 (18.2%) and 74 (4.5%) patients, respectively. The complication rate for the procedure was 4.8% (nâ=â79). False negative results were detected in 5 Patients (2.2%). For the entire cohort, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and accuracy were 98.68% (95% CI 96.95-99.57%), 100% (95% CI 99.65-100%), 99.53 (95% CI 98.88-99.8%), and 99.65% (95% CI 99.19-99.89%), respectively.

The PACIFIC trial established consolidation with the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy as the standard-of-care approach. Furthermore, the LAURA trial has redefined the treatment of patients with stage III unresectable EGFR-mutant NSCLC, demonstrating unprecedented progression-free survival durations with osimertinib consolidation. Despite these advances, novel approaches are urgently needed. Circulating tumour DNA-based monitoring of minimal residual disease is emerging as a personalized method of tailoring treatment duration and escalation strategies. Novel radiotherapy techniques have the potential to provide synergy with immunotherapy while minimizing toxicities. Additionally, ongoing trials evaluating chemoimmunotherapy combinations adapted from the neoadjuvant setting with the potential for conversion to resectable disease might, in the near future, redefine the boundary of surgical resectability. In this Review, we describe the rapidly evolving field of unresectable stage III NSCLC, providing a state-of-the-art overview that includes challenging topics such as biomarkers, personalization of therapy and the role of immunotherapy rechallenge."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1b (LRP1b) is a cell surface receptor, commonly altered in many cancers and associated with improved responses, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI).\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: LRP1b alterations were determined by whole exome sequencing (WES) and associated with PFS and objective response rates (ORR) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in post-hoc analysis of the randomized controlled phase 3 Checkmate-026 trial (CM026, NCT02041533) examining chemotherapy vs nivolumab, adjusting for tumor mutational burden (TMB) and clinical features. We separately evaluated a de-identified nationwide (US-based) NSCLC clinico-genomic database (CGDB) for associations of LRP1b alterations and progression-free survival with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.\n\nRESULTS: In the CGDB cohort of patients with NSCLC (N=18,369), LRP1b mutations were positively associated with TP53/KRAS alterations and inversely with EGFR/RET/MET/ERBB2 alterations and significantly improved PFS with PD-1 inhibition (n=1569, adjusted HR 0.86 p=0.014). In CM026, patients with LRP1b alterations had a statistically significant improvement in ORR to nivolumab vs. LRP1b wild-type (wt) patients (odds ratio 3.5; 95% CI 1.71-7.13; p=0.0006) but not with chemotherapy (odds ratio 0.63; 95% CI 0.32-1.26; p=0.19), adjusting for TMB, age, gender, histology, smoking and performance status. LRP1b mutations were associated with improved PFS with nivolumab (HR 0.66, p=0.04) but not chemotherapy (HR 1.26, p=0.25), also maintained in multivariate and TMB adjusted analysis.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: LRP1b mutations are a candidate predictive biomarker for ICI vs. chemotherapy in NSCLC. Further mechanistic characterization of LRP1b and prospective validation are warranted, and might enable future clinical use."

      "abstract": "Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) have poor prognosis and limited treatment options beyond first-line therapy. B7Â homolog 3 (B7-H3) is minimally expressed in normal tissues but highly expressed in SCLC. Ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd), a B7-H3-directed antibody-drug conjugate, has demonstrated promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile in various tumours, including SCLC. IDeate-Lung02 is a global, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study ofâ~540 patients with relapsed SCLC. Adults with one prior line of platinum-based systemic therapy, ECOG performance status 0-1, andââ¥1 measurable lesion (per RECIST 1.1) are eligible for study participation. Patients with asymptomatic untreated or previously treated brain metastases may participate. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive I-DXd 12âmg/kg intravenously every 3âweeks or treatment of physician's choice (topotecan, amrubicin, or lurbinectedin). Dual primary endpoints are objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR) and overall survival. Secondary endpoints include ORR by investigator; progression-free survival, duration of response, disease control rate, and time to response, all by BICR and investigator; patient-reported outcomes; and safety. IDeate-Lung02 will ascertain whether I-DXd treatment after only one prior line of systemic treatment improves outcomes for patients with relapsed SCLC compared with topotecan, amrubicin, or lurbinectedin."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of therapeutics that combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with cytotoxic or immune-stimulatory payloads. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), they offer a novel strategy with potential in both first line therapy and in cases to overcome resistance to existing targeted and immune-based therapies.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To review the clinical development, efficacy, safety, biomarker strategies, and emerging targets of ADCs in NSCLC, with a focus on implications for practice and ongoing challenges.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review of published trials, conference abstracts, and press releases evaluating ADCs in NSCLC, with attention to target antigens, clinical trial outcomes, and biomarker approaches.\n\nRESULTS: ADCs targeting HER2, TROP2, and c-MET have received regulatory approval in NSCLC, with demonstrated efficacy-particularly in biomarker-selected populations. Bispecific HER3/EGFR-directed ADCs have shown encouraging activity in early-phase studies, with ongoing trials expected to clarify durability and optimal patient selection. Other targets such as ITGB6, B7-H3, and AXL have shown early signals of efficacy. Predictive biomarkers vary in reliability, and mutation, amplification, or protein expression do not uniformly predict response. Toxicity and acquired resistance remain key challenges; improved diagnostics may enhance patient selection.\n\nCONCLUSION: ADCs are poised to reshape the therapeutic landscape of NSCLC. Their success will hinge on refining biomarker strategies, managing toxicity, and integrating resistance-mitigating approaches such as bispecific constructs or rational combinations. As research advances, ADCs may become essential components of personalized therapy across a range of molecular and histologic NSCLC subtypes."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% of lung cancers and is characterized by an aggressive disease course and historically poor prognosis. Although tumors in most patients respond to initial chemotherapy, relapse is nearly universal and treatment options remain limited. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a novel therapeutic class with potential to address this unmet need.\n\nMETHODS: ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and their associated references and press releases were queried for the search terms \"Antibody-drug conjugates\" and \"SCLC.\" Only English-language sources were included.\n\nRESULTS: Multiple ADCs targeting diverse antigens have been evaluated in relapsed or refractory SCLC. Topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads have generated the most consistent activity across DLL3, TROP2, B7-H3, and SEZ6 targets, while microtubule and pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD)- based constructs have not demonstrated durable benefit. Despite encouraging response rates, progression-free survival has remained short, reflecting intrinsic resistance, antigen heterogeneity, and toxicity-related dose limitations.\n\nCONCLUSION: While ADCs have generated encouraging response rates in SCLC, durability has remained limited. Future development will require optimization of payloads, linkers, and trial design to determine whether ADCs can achieve a sustained role in this disease."
