      "abstract": "Dysregulated ISC metabolism has been implicated in cancer progression, but its role in LUAD pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that ISC biogenesis is significantly upregulated in LUAD, driven by transcription factors KLF15 and ZNF384, which activate GLRX5, LYRM4, NFS1 and BOLA3 promoters. IL-1β promotes PCAF mitochondrial translocation, releasing EP300 to amplify KLF15/ZNF384-mediated transcriptional activation. The natural monoterpenoid Hinokitiol inhibits LUAD growth by disrupting EP300-KLF15/ZNF384 interactions, suppressing ISC biogenesis gene expression and inducing ferroptosis. Mechanistically, the membrane protein TMDD1, particularly its cytoplasmic domain, promotes Hinokitiol's anti-tumor effects by facilitating EP300-KLF15/ZNF384 dissociation and inhibiting ISC biogenesis. Remarkably, Hinokitiol exhibits stage-dependent efficacy, with superior suppression of metastatic (stage IV) tumors linked to heightened ferroptosis sensitivity. This study not only elucidates the transcriptional machinery governing ISC biogenesis in LUAD but also highlights Hinokitiol's dual mechanism as a promising stage-specific therapeutic agent, offering novel strategies for advanced disease management."

      "abstract": "The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer (LC) screening trial (Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek [NELSON]) demonstrated low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduces LC mortality by 24% among men. The NELSON protocol differed from previous trials in the eligibility criteria, the use of volume-based nodule management, and increasing screening intervals. The early-stage sensitivity of the protocol is pivotal in determining the optimal screening strategy, such as the interval and age range. The MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis-Lung natural history model was used to reproduce LC incidence and mortality by detection method (clinical or screen-detected), sex, histology, and stage in the NELSON trial based on individual-level data. We evaluated screening effectiveness by stage and histology, accounting for population characteristics, trial design, and LC epidemiology. We find stage IA non-small cell LC (NSCLC) sensitivity of 24.6% (other NSCLC) to 41.0% (adenocarcinoma) at baseline screening. At repeat screening rounds, we find this increased to 70.9% for stage IA adenocarcinoma. For stage IB, the sensitivity by histology ranges from 26.4% to 77.1%; for stage II, 39.6%-81.9%. Upon detection, the probability of LC mortality prevention is estimated at 83% for stage IA. The sensitivity for detecting early-stage LC is found to depend on the histology of cancer and is increased for adenocarcinoma at repeat screenings. Despite a low rate of referral to follow-up screening in the NELSON trial, early-stage CT sensitivity and the probability of mortality prevention were similar to previous estimates from the National Lung cancer Screening Trial. Previously demonstrated screening effectiveness may be maintained when implementing new programs, while reducing unnecessary follow-up when considering NELSON evidence."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Subcutaneous (SC) formulations of oncology therapies could provide time-saving benefits for both patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) compared with intravenous (IV) delivery. This prospective observational study, conducted alongside the MK-3475A-D77 phase 3, open-label randomized clinical trial, quantifies HCP and patient time with pembrolizumab SC versus pembrolizumab IV among patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nMETHODS: Seventeen sites across eight countries in Europe (n = 4), South America (n = 3), and Asia (n = 1) were enrolled. Primary endpoints were active HCP time; patient time in the treatment chair, treatment room, and healthcare facility; and consumables usage. Descriptive statistics included weighted mean (WM), and a linear mixed model (LMM) was employed to explore differences in time measures between pembrolizumab SC and pembrolizumab IV per visit.\n\nRESULTS: Overall, 212 observations were analyzed (153 SC and 59 IV). Total active HCP time was reduced by 45.6% with SC versus IV (WM, 14.0 vs 25.8 min); HCPs spent 44.3% less time on the drug preparation process with SC versus IV (WM, 5.1 vs 9.1 min) and 46.3% less time on the drug administration process with SC versus IV (WM, 8.9 vs 16.7 min). Patient chair time was reduced by 49.6% with SC versus IV (WM, 59.0 vs 117.2 min). Patients receiving SC spent less time in the treatment room than those receiving IV (WM, 66.7 vs 126.9 min; difference - 47.4%). Exploratory LMM showed considerable between-group differences for active HCP time and patient time in the treatment chair and treatment room.\n\nCONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab SC substantially reduces active HCP time and patient chair time versus pembrolizumab IV. Time liberated for HCPs could be reallocated toward additional patient care activities, while optimized chair utilization could improve overall healthcare efficiency."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate staging of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential to determine further management. Current guidelines recommend confirmatory mediastinoscopy for patients with suspicious mediastinal lymph node metastases in image-based staging but negative findings on endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). In clinical practice, adherence to these recommendations is low and many physicians omit invasive surgical staging. This study aimed to assess the results of subsequent video-assisted mediastinoscopic lymphadenectomy (VAMLA).\n\nMETHODS: Retrospective single-center cohort analysis of patients who underwent surgery between 2015 and 2019. All patients were diagnosed with potentially resectable lung cancer or FDG-avid pulmonary nodule suspicious for NSCLC and underwent VAMLA following N0-N2 EBUS-TBNA for mediastinal staging.\n\nRESULTS: VAMLA was performed in 228 patients. Nodal upstaging after EBUS-TBNA occurred in 17.5 % of the cases (n = 40). During EBUS-TBNA, 1.72 (±1.06) lymph node stations were sampled, compared to 5.59 (±1.1) resected stations in VAMLA (p < 0.001). Clinical nodal status staged by PET/CT was significantly correlated with the occurrence of nodal upstaging by VAMLA, with an odds ratio of 7.69 in cN2 and 5.88 in patients with cN3, compared to cN0. Complications occurred in 8 patients (3.59 %). VAMLA was false negative in 1 patient (0.4 %).\n\nCONCLUSION: Subsequent VAMLA enables the accurate staging of patients after negative EBUS-TBNA. Overall, 17.5 % of cases had nodal upstaging and would otherwise not have received guideline-compliant treatment for NSCLC. These results underline the role of surgical mediastinal staging after negative EBUS-TBNA in patients with suspicious radiologic findings."

Data were collected on patient demographics, cancer staging, treatment type, and time to PE onset.\n\nRESULTS: Among patients who developed PE during lung cancer treatment, the mean age was 66.82 ± 10.50 years. Females comprised 64.04% of cases, adenocarcinoma was identified in 60.38%, and stage IV lung cancer was present in 56.60%. First-line therapy was administered in 63.21% of cases, and 66.04% exhibited enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. The mean D-dimer level among this cohort was 3.559 μg/mL, indicating a heightened thrombotic risk. Temporally, 50.95% of PE cases occurred within 6 months of lung cancer diagnosis. Onset within 3 months following therapy initiation was observed across multiple modalities: 46.15% for chemotherapy, 34.78% for targeted therapy, and 77.78% following surgical intervention. Notably, 16.98% of PE events occurred during the initial chemotherapy cycle. The mean time to PE onset was 1.81 ± 2.51 months for patients undergoing surgery alone, compared to 15.52 ± 12.88 months for those receiving surgery combined with other treatments (P < 0.05). Surgical intervention was identified as an independent risk factor for PE. In early-stage lung cancer, the mean time to PE onset was significantly shorter, with a mean time of 16.38 ± 21.07 months (P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION: The timing and incidence of PE vary according to the type of antitumor therapy administered in lung cancer treatment. These findings underscore the importance of vigilant monitoring, personalized risk assessment, and targeted anticoagulation strategies throughout the therapeutic course."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend cisplatin as the preferred platinum agent in the first-line treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), especially limited-stage disease (LS-SCLC). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, carboplatin use likely increased due to logistical advantages. We evaluated the pandemic's impact on platinum agent utilization in the Netherlands and compared overall survival (OS) and safety between cisplatin and carboplatin.\n\nMETHODS: Using Netherlands Cancer Registry data, first-line platinum-based treatments for LS-SCLC and extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) between 2018 and 2023 were analyzed. OS was evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses. Grades 3-5 treatment-related adverse events were studied in three hospitals.\n\nFINDINGS: Overall, 1683 LS-SCLC (carboplatin, N = 1011[60 %]; cisplatin, N = 672[40 %]) and 3668 ES-SCLC (carboplatin, N = 3002[82 %]; cisplatin, N = 666[18 %]) patients were included. During the pandemic, quarterly usage rates of carboplatin reached up to 81 % and 90 % in LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC, respectively. In LS-SCLC, univariable analysis showed significantly shorter median OS with carboplatin compared to cisplatin (17.9m vs. 26.3m; HR, 1.48; 95 %CI, 1.31-1.68; p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in ES-SCLC (8.0m vs. 9.3m; HR, 1.19; 95 %CI, 1.09-1.30; p < 0.001). However, multivariable analyses, after adjusting for confounders, showed no significant OS differences in either LS-SCLC (HR, 1.06; 95 %CI, 0.90-1.25; p = 0.463) or ES-SCLC (HR, 1.01; 95 %CI, 0.92-1.12; p = 0.785). Confounders were performance status (PS), age, sex, and chemoradiotherapy type for LS-SCLC, and PS, age, sex, stage, and liver metastases for ES-SCLC. Hematologic toxicity was higher with carboplatin, while cisplatin led to more nonhematologic toxicity.\n\nINTERPRETATION: These findings challenge the long-standing belief of cisplatin's superiority and support the adoption of carboplatin in SCLC."

For analysis of clinicogenomic baseline characteristics and overall survival (OS), patients were stratified by age at diagnosis into a young cohort (YC; n = 56, ≤45 years), an older cohort (OC; n = 2.682, >45 years) and analysed across age decades.\n\nRESULTS: 71 of 2.738 patients with LC (2.59 %) were ≤ 45 years old. 56/71 were diagnosed with NSCLC or SCLC. YC frequently reported no history of smoking (21 % vs. 6 %; p < 0.001). Among YC, adenocarcinoma (59 % vs. 49 %) and NSCLC not-otherwise-specified (NSCLC NOS; 27 % vs. 8.2 %) were the dominant histological subtypes (p < 0.001). Stage IV disease was significantly more common in YC (stage IV: 66 % vs. 44 %; p = 0.005) with more frequent regional lymph node involvement (N1-N3 79 % vs. 56.9 %) and extrathoracic lymph node metastases (38 % vs. 14 %; p < 0.001). Frequent targetable genomic alterations in YC included ALK translocations (21 % vs. 2.2 %; p < 0.001). YC with metastatic NSCLC had similar median OS compared to OC, although OS was improved in those with targetable alterations.\n\nCONCLUSION: Early-onset LC is characterized by advanced disease stage, adenocarcinoma histopathology and frequent targetable genomic alterations, especially in patients without a history of smoking. Early diagnosis remains a critical unmet medical need in this subgroup of patients."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) gene fusions are critical oncogenic drivers that activate the ERBB signaling pathway across various solid tumors. Although targeted therapies for NRG1 fusion-positive cancers are advancing rapidly in clinical settings, their epidemiological and clinicogenomic characteristics remain poorly understood, warranting large-scale investigations.\n\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with advanced solid tumors who were registered in the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics database of Japan between June 2019 and February 2025. Our evaluation focused on the prevalence of NRG1 fusions, identities of fusion partners, co-occurring genomic alterations, tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability status, and relevant clinical characteristics.\n\nRESULTS: Our study included 95,149 patients with advanced solid tumors who underwent comprehensive genomic profiling. Among them, 29 (0.03 %) harbored NRG1 fusions, most frequently in lung cancer (17 of 5,670 cases, 0.30 %). CD74 emerged as the predominant fusion partner, constituting 82.4 % of lung cancers, whereas other solid tumors exhibited a more diverse range of partners. Co-occurring genomic alterations were detected in 20 of 29 patients (69.0 %), with the most frequent alterations found in CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP. Additionally, pathological examination revealed mucinous adenocarcinoma in 17.6 % of lung cancers associated with NRG1 fusions.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study confirms that NRG1 fusions are rare but significantly associated with lung cancer and the CD74 fusion partner. Our nationwide analysis represents the most comprehensive assessment of NRG1 fusions in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) who develop lung cancer represent a unique challenge, as they are at higher risk for serious toxicity from local and systemic therapies. The aim of this study is to provide an up-to-date analysis on toxicities and outcomes associated with definitive radiation therapy (RT) in patients with ILD and early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC).\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception until June 2024, for studies including patients with ILD who underwent definitive RT alone for ES-NSCLC. Data including treatment-related mortality, toxicity, local control, and overall survival were collected and analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Of 3545 records reviewed, 24 studies were identified for full data abstraction, contributing a total of 705 patients. A specific ILD subtype was not reported for 71% (n = 502) of patients. ILD severity was not reported for 62% (n = 440) of patients. Risk of treatment-related mortality was 7.9%, with severe treatment-related respiratory toxicity 15.7%. A higher volume of lung receiving ≥5 Gy (V5) was significantly correlated with mortality. The estimated local control at 3 year was 76% and median overall survival was 2.5 years.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The relative merits of RT for the treatment of ES-NSCLC in patients with ILD should be considered in the context of the rates of treatment-related mortality and toxicity. Future studies would benefit from consistent reporting of ILD characteristics, which may help in risk stratification in this challenging clinical scenario."

Surgery and radiotherapy are the primary local treatment modalities, and their use guided by the principals of tumor resectability and patient operability. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant immunotherapy have changed the patterns of multidisciplinary management of stage III NSCLC. On behalf of the Multidisciplinary Clinical Science Committee and Advanced Radiotherapy Technology Subcommittee of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), we present five cases representing challenging scenarios for discussion. The first is strategies for optimizing staging prior to curative-intent, particularly the role of endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). The second focuses on the role of targeted therapies in the curative-intent chemoradiotherapy paradigm. The third examines treatment approaches for elderly or comorbid patients, specifically the choice between radiotherapy or systemic therapy. The fourth considers the management of patients who do not undergo surgery after neoadjuvant systemic therapy. The fifth concerns the role of adjuvant radiotherapy following neoadjuvant therapy and surgery. Herein, we present a review of challenging clinical scenarios often encountered in thoracic multidisciplinary tumor boards."

This study investigates factors influencing outcomes with first-line MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) versus immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) ± chemotherapy.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clinicopathologic data were collected from patients with metastatic MET exon 14 skipping-mutant non-small cell lung cancer treated with first-line MET TKI or ICI ± chemotherapy at five centers. Primary endpoints were real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and overall survival (OS) to first-line MET TKI versus ICI ± chemotherapy. Subgroup analyses by clinical and tumor characteristics were performed.\n\nRESULTS: Among 158 patients, 80 received MET TKI and 78 received ICI ± chemotherapy as first-line treatment. Baseline clinicopathologic features were balanced except for a higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking in the ICI ± chemotherapy group (P = 0.03). With a median follow-up of 37.9 months, no difference was observed in rwPFS (HR, 0.85; P = 0.4) or OS (HR, 0.97; P = 0.9) with first-line MET TKI versus ICI ± chemotherapy. In subgroup analyses, first-line ICI ± chemotherapy improved rwPFS in PD-L1 ≥80% (HR, 0.50; P = 0.03), whereas MET TKI improved rwPFS (HR, 0.40; P = 0.005) and OS (HR, 0.49; P = 0.03) in PD-L1 <50%, as well as rwPFS (HR, 0.39; P = 0.02) and OS (HR, 0.36; P = 0.03) in brain metastases and rwPFS (HR, 0.55; P = 0.01) in bone metastases. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of high-grade toxicity (P = 0.9) or rates of permanent treatment discontinuation (P = 0.2) between first-line MET TKI and ICI ± chemotherapy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: First-line MET TKI improved outcomes in PD-L1 <50% and brain/bone metastases, whereas ICI ± chemotherapy prolonged PFS only in PD-L1 ≥80%, emphasizing the need for personalized treatment selection."

The panel formulated four PICO (population, intervention, comparison and outcomes) questions and seven complementary narrative questions. Both types of questions were assigned to groups of at least two experts. A medical librarian conducted the literature searches, and the authors selected relevant studies based on predefined inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS (Quality in Prognosis Studies) tool. Data were summarised and the certainty of evidence was assessed with GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) and the Evidence to Decisions framework was used to formulate recommendations. A series of multidisciplinary recommendations was formulated about the utilisation of pulmonary function tests, split lung function values, exercise tests, cardiologic testing, and the role of prehabilitation, sublobar resections, risk scores and comorbidities in selecting patients for curative intent treatment."

N1 metrics were dichotomized based on optimal cutoffs determined by overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models were utilized to assess disease-free survival (DFS) and OS and to identify independent prognostic factors.\n\nRESULTS: In multivariable analysis, a high N1 LNR emerged as the sole N1 metric that independently predicted worse DFS (HR = 1.47, 95 % CI: 1.05-2.04, p = 0.023). In contrast, its prognostic significance for OS was attenuated (p = 0.162). However, an advanced pT4 stage (p = 0.044) was an independent predictor of worse OS, while adjuvant therapy (p = 0.016) was associated with improved OS. Notably, subgroup analysis revealed that an elevated N1 LNR independently predicted worse DFS in the pN2a subgroup (p = 0.009). Building on this, we developed a novel three-tiered stratification (pN2a-low LNR, pN2a-high LNR, and pN2b) that effectively discriminated patient outcomes for both DFS (p < 0.001) and OS (p < 0.01).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: N1 LNR is a powerful and independent predictor of disease recurrence in non-skip pN2 NSCLC, outperforming other N1 metrics for predicting DFS. Incorporating N1 LNR into clinical assessments, particularly for pN2a patients, can enhance prognostic accuracy and potentially guidemore personalized surveillance and treatment strategies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. The lack of effective targeted therapies for SCLC is a major limitation of this field. Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal (BET) inhibitors have emerged as a promising class of anticancer agents. This study aimed to evaluate the preclinical efficacy and mechanism of action of NHWD-870, a novel BET inhibitor targeting BRD4, in SCLC.\n\nMETHOD: The therapeutic effects of NHWD-870 on SCLC have been validated through compassionate use. The anti-tumor effects of NHWD-870 were explored using in vitro and in vivo models. CCK-8 assays and flow cytometry were utilized to examine cell viability, apoptosis, and mechanisms of cell cycle arrest. The in vivo effectiveness of NHWD-870 was evaluated using cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC. Mechanistic studies involving RNA sequencing, Western blotting, qPCR, and transfection were conducted to investigate and confirm the underlying mechanisms of NHWD-870.\n\nRESULT: Our study observed the efficacy of NHWD-870 in a patient with SCLC. NHWD-870 demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity against SCLC in both in vitro and in vivo models, effectively halting tumor growth, inducing apoptosis, and disrupting the cell cycle. RNA sequencing confirmed that the cell cycle is its primary pathway of action, with BRD4, STRADA, and CCND1 identified as key targets.\n\nCONCLUSION: NHWD-870 exhibits anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo against SCLC, primarily by regulating the BRD4/STRADA/CCND1 axis and inhibiting the transition of the cell cycle from the G1 phase to the S phase. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of NHWD-870 as a novel BET inhibitor for SCLC treatment and provide a molecular basis for further clinical development."

Baseline assessment (T0) data were collected at the first day of hospitalization, including demographic, clinical characteristics, psychological (psychological resilience, symptom burden, anxiety, medical coping styles), and social (social support) factors. Measurements were repeated at 3 days after surgery (T1), the day of hospital discharge (T2), 3 months post-discharge (T3), 6 months post-discharge (T4), and 1 year post-discharge (T5). A latent class growth model (LCGM) was used to define different classes of trajectories of psychological resilience.\n\nRESULTS: Data from 333 patients were analyzed. The three latent classes had a similar pattern across different intercepts, with a significant decrease from T0 to T2, followed by a significant increase from T2 to T5, and with T5 being higher than T0. The three trajectories were named Class 1 (sustained high), Class 2 (rapid recovery), and Class 3 (slow recovery), respectively. Multiple logistic regressions showed that Class 1 (sustained high) predicted higher social support, aged 20 ~ 40, being male and a civil servant, and Class 2 (rapid recovery), and Class 3 (slow recovery) predicted higher anxiety and resignation coping compared to Class 1.\n\nCONCLUSION: Healthcare providers should pay attention to periods of declining psychological resilience and implement interventions for vulnerable populations."
