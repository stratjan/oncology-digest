      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN) play a key role in inducing and promoting antitumor immunity. TDLN are commonly situated near the primary tumor and are therefore often exposed to therapeutic radiation. The impact of induction therapies comprising concurrent immunotherapy and radiation on TDLN is poorly understood. We studied the immune-modulating effects in TDLN of patients with T3-4N0-2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using a combination of spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemical analyses.\n\nMETHODS: This observational cohort study collected TDLN from 2 groups: (1) patients from the INCREASE trial who were treated with neoadjuvant ipilimumab/nivolumab (IPI/NIVO) plus chemoradiotherapy (CRT) (n=25) and (2) a matched control cohort of patients with NSCLC who had neoadjuvant CRT only (n=25). TDLN were classified based on the cumulative dose of radiation received, categorized as low (≤5 Gy), intermediate (20-30 Gy), or high dose (50-60 Gy). The TDLN were subjected to duplex immunohistochemistry of CD8/Ki67, PD-1/FOXP3, and CD8/cleaved caspase-3. On a subset of TDLN, additional GeoMx spatial transcriptomics profiling of CD8/Ki67+T cell hotspots was carried out.\n\nRESULTS: After addition of IPI/NIVO to CRT in the INCREASE cohort, resected TDLN showed robust type I immune responses and increased levels of CD8 and regulatory T cells in irradiated TDLN when compared with the control cohort. These immune responses were observed across all radiation dose groups, with the most pronounced effects in high dose TDLN. Significant changes in extracellular matrix and macrophage-associated gene signatures, indicating elevated fibrosis and prolonged inflammation, were observed in the TDLN with high radiation exposure, changes which were partially alleviated by immunotherapy.\n\nCONCLUSION: In the INCREASE trial, neoadjuvant IPI/NIVO combined with CRT for patients with T3-4N0-2 NSCLC elicited enhanced immune responses in TDLN despite exposure to high dose radiation. Even though radiation-induced fibrosis was evident in high dose TDLN, the immune responses were not diminished when compared with low dose TDLN. These findings underscore the resilience of TDLN immunological function under intense radiation exposure."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly anti-PD-(L)1s, have transformed cancer care by their extended efficacy, even receiving next-line. Event-free survival 2 (EFS2), progression/recurrence-free survival 2 (PRFS2) and progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) capture the time from randomization to objective recurrence/progression or death on the first subsequent therapy, potentially offering a more accurate measure of durable benefit than first-event endpoints. Our aim is to review the magnitude of this benefit and evaluate long-term endpoints as surrogates for overall survival (OS) in immunotherapy for solid malignancies.\n\nMETHODS: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis searched Web of Science, National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry, American Society of Clinical Oncology and European Society of Medical Oncology conference databases from inception until June 12, 2025, for anti-PD-(L)1-based randomized controlled phase II/III clinical trials (RCTs) in patients with solid malignancies that reported EFS2, PRFS2 or PFS2. HRs comparing ICI and non-ICI arms were pooled using a random-effects meta-analytic approach. Sensitivity analyses and meta-regressions assessed effect modifiers. A linear regression compared EFS2/PRFS2/PFS2 and EFS/disease-free survival (DFS)/PFS versus OS HRs.\n\nRESULTS: 47 RCTs met inclusion criteria from 2,078 citations, comprising 58 intervention comparisons (ICs) and 34,973 patients. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was the most investigated tumor (17 RCTs). Anti-PD-(L)1s performed generally worse when administered as a subsequent therapy in non-ICI-experienced patients (p<0.05). Early anti-PD-(L)1 use was associated with significantly improved EFS2/PRFS2/PFS2 (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.76), with consistent findings across curative and recurrent/metastatic settings, and particularly strong effects in RCTs involving patients with deficient mismatch repair or high microsatellite instability tumors and those with more radiological responses. In 54 ICs reporting both OS and EFS2/PRFS2/PFS2 HRs, a strong correlation (R²=0.74) was observed across all RCTs, and an even stronger 0.86 specifically among patients with NSCLC (22 ICs). Conversely, EFS/DFS/PFS presented R² 0.39 across all RCTs (51 ICs), and 0.65 in NSCLC (21 ICs; p<0.01).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Early use of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy is associated with prolonged disease control and may be linked to enhanced responsiveness to subsequent therapies, mostly based on NSCLC data. Additionally, EFS2/PRFS2/PFS2 are solid candidate surrogates for OS and could be considered for routine inclusion and prespecified into immunotherapy RCTs to better capture long-term benefit and inform regulatory, clinical, and reimbursement decision-making.\n\nPROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42024585378."

      "abstract": "Accurate smoking documentation in electronic health records (EHRs) is crucial for risk assessment and patient monitoring. However, key information is often missing or inaccurately recorded. Large language models (LLMs) present a promising solution for interpreting clinical narratives to extract comprehensive smoking data. We developed a framework utilizing LLMs combined with rule-based longitudinal smoothing techniques to enhance data quality. We compared generative LLMs (Gemini-1.5-Flash, PaLM-2-Text-Bison, GPT-4) against BERT-based models using 1683 manually annotated clinical notes from 518 patients across Stanford and Sutter Health systems. Generative LLMs achieved superior performance ( > 96% accuracy) across seven smoking variables, with external validation showing robust generalizability (97.5-98.8% accuracy). We deployed Gemini-1.5-Flash to 79,408 notes from 4792 lung cancer patients, demonstrating that risk model-based surveillance incorporating smoking factors outperformed NCCN Guidelines in identifying second malignancies. Our study highlights the potential of generative LLMs to improve smoking history documentation quality, enhancing lung cancer surveillance and broader clinical applications."

      "abstract": "Drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells drive therapeutic resistance in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a clinically significant RGS5+MYL9+ cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) population that was associated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance and poor prognosis. These CAFs were recruited to DTP niches via CCL11 signaling, and they formed tunneling nanotubes through Miro1/RhoA activation induced by TKI-generated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Remarkably, RGS5+MYL9+ CAFs functioned as \"metabolic sinks\" by accepting tumor-derived damaged mitochondria, thereby promoting DTP survival. Treatment with fasudil, a Rho kinase inhibitor, effectively blocked mitochondrial transfer and restored sensitivity to the EGFR-TKI osimertinib in vivo. Together, this work reveals targetable stromal-tumor crosstalk that sustains DTP populations, proposing a combination therapy for overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance."

      "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1 are found in more than 20% of non-small cell lung cancers. These mutations stabilize the transcription factor NRF2 to induce a battery of antioxidative and cytoprotective genes. Although NRF2 accumulation promotes cancer cell fitness, it also creates several targetable vulnerabilities. In this issue of Cancer Research, Gebru and colleagues reveal the dependency of KEAP1-mutant non-small cell lung cancers on UDP-xylose synthase 1 (UXS1). The authors found that NRF2-driven expression of UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase leads to the accumulation of UDP-glucuronic acid. Consequently, loss of UXS1-mediated UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylation causes sequestration of UDP, depletion of pyrimidine pools, and replication stress, thereby inducing apoptosis and senescence. Importantly, these effects are selective to KEAP1-mutant tumors, with KEAP1 wild-type cells and normal tissue unaffected by UXS1 loss. DNA damage induction with cell-cycle kinase inhibitors synergized with UXS1 loss to promote the death of KEAP1-mutant cells. These findings suggest that UXS1 loss is synthetic lethal with NRF2 activation and may be a promising target for therapy. See related article by Gebru et al., p. 4806."

      "abstract": "Dysregulated ISC metabolism has been implicated in cancer progression, but its role in LUAD pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that ISC biogenesis is significantly upregulated in LUAD, driven by transcription factors KLF15 and ZNF384, which activate GLRX5, LYRM4, NFS1 and BOLA3 promoters. IL-1β promotes PCAF mitochondrial translocation, releasing EP300 to amplify KLF15/ZNF384-mediated transcriptional activation. The natural monoterpenoid Hinokitiol inhibits LUAD growth by disrupting EP300-KLF15/ZNF384 interactions, suppressing ISC biogenesis gene expression and inducing ferroptosis. Mechanistically, the membrane protein TMDD1, particularly its cytoplasmic domain, promotes Hinokitiol's anti-tumor effects by facilitating EP300-KLF15/ZNF384 dissociation and inhibiting ISC biogenesis. Remarkably, Hinokitiol exhibits stage-dependent efficacy, with superior suppression of metastatic (stage IV) tumors linked to heightened ferroptosis sensitivity. This study not only elucidates the transcriptional machinery governing ISC biogenesis in LUAD but also highlights Hinokitiol's dual mechanism as a promising stage-specific therapeutic agent, offering novel strategies for advanced disease management."

      "abstract": "The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer (LC) screening trial (Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek [NELSON]) demonstrated low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduces LC mortality by 24% among men. The NELSON protocol differed from previous trials in the eligibility criteria, the use of volume-based nodule management, and increasing screening intervals. The early-stage sensitivity of the protocol is pivotal in determining the optimal screening strategy, such as the interval and age range. The MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis-Lung natural history model was used to reproduce LC incidence and mortality by detection method (clinical or screen-detected), sex, histology, and stage in the NELSON trial based on individual-level data. We evaluated screening effectiveness by stage and histology, accounting for population characteristics, trial design, and LC epidemiology. We find stage IA non-small cell LC (NSCLC) sensitivity of 24.6% (other NSCLC) to 41.0% (adenocarcinoma) at baseline screening. At repeat screening rounds, we find this increased to 70.9% for stage IA adenocarcinoma. For stage IB, the sensitivity by histology ranges from 26.4% to 77.1%; for stage II, 39.6%-81.9%. Upon detection, the probability of LC mortality prevention is estimated at 83% for stage IA. The sensitivity for detecting early-stage LC is found to depend on the histology of cancer and is increased for adenocarcinoma at repeat screenings. Despite a low rate of referral to follow-up screening in the NELSON trial, early-stage CT sensitivity and the probability of mortality prevention were similar to previous estimates from the National Lung cancer Screening Trial. Previously demonstrated screening effectiveness may be maintained when implementing new programs, while reducing unnecessary follow-up when considering NELSON evidence."

For patients with EGFR uncommon mutations, monotherapy with either a second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), afatinib, or a third-generation EGFR-TKI, osimertinib, is recommended as the initial therapy. However, needs remain unmet for patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and those who do not respond adequately to single-agent TKI therapy for EGFR uncommon mutations. The recently published FLAURA2 trial showed that osimertinib in combination with platinum-pemetrexed significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and provided high disease control compared with osimertinib monotherapy for common mutations. Therefore, we planned this phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of osimertinib in combination with platinum-pemetrexed in treatment-naïve NSCLC patients with EGFR uncommon mutations.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients will be enrolled in the study. The primary endpoint is the objective response rate, and the secondary endpoints include safety, PFS and overall survival in overall patients, patients with and without CNS lesions at baseline and according to mutation subtype.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, we will explore the efficacy and safety of osimertinib in combination with platinum-pemetrexed in treatment-naïve NSCLC patients with EGFR uncommon mutations. Our findings may provide treatment options for patients with EGFR uncommon mutations, especially those with CNS metastases or those requiring more intensive treatment."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the phase 3 CASPIAN study, first-line durvalumab plus etoposide combined with either carboplatin or cisplatin (EP) significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus EP alone in treatment-naïve extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We report exploratory subgroup analyses from CASPIAN.\n\nMETHODS: Patients with untreated ES-SCLC were randomized to durvalumab plus EP or EP alone. We analyzed OS and safety in subgroups defined by age, sex, and planned platinum agent, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) by age.\n\nRESULTS: Of 537 patients (durvalumab plus EP: n = 268; EP alone: n = 269), 80.6% versus 19.4% were aged <70 versus ≥70 years; 69.6% versus 30.4% were male versus female; and planned platinum was cisplatin versus carboplatin in 25.1% versus 74.9%. The OS HRs for durvalumab plus EP versus EP were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.58-0.88) versus 0.74 (95% CI, 0.49-1.11) for patients aged <70 versus ≥70 years; 0.76 (95% CI, 0.62-0.95) versus 0.60 (95% CI, 0.42-0.84) for males versus females; and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.45-0.94) versus 0.74 (95% CI, 0.60-0.91) for planned cisplatin versus carboplatin. With durvalumab plus EP, rates of grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were similar across subgroups; serious AEs were more frequent in patients aged ≥70 versus <70 years; and immune-mediated AEs were more common in females versus males. Adding durvalumab to EP had no detrimental effect on PROs in either age subgroup.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of durvalumab plus EP as first-line standard of care for ES-SCLC. Additional trials focused on elderly populations would be informative."

This exploratory analysis focused on patients with tumor cell programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression ≥ 50%.\n\nMETHODS: Patients with stage IIIB/IV nsq-NSCLC were randomized (2:1) to tislelizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy and pemetrexed every 3 weeks, followed by maintenance tislelizumab and pemetrexed, or platinum-based chemotherapy and pemetrexed followed by maintenance pemetrexed. The primary endpoint was independent review committee (IRC)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), IRC-assessed objective response rates, and safety.\n\nRESULTS: The PD-L1 ≥ 50% population included 110 patients (tislelizumab plus chemotherapy, n = 74; chemotherapy, n = 36); 71.8% (n = 79) were male and 28.2% (n = 31) were female. Consistent with the final analysis (median follow-up 16.5 months), the 4-year follow-up data (median follow-up 23.4 months) continued to show an improvement in median PFS (17.2 vs. 4.6 months; stratified HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.17-0.50) and median OS (41.9 vs. 13.1 months; stratified HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23-0.62) for patients who received tislelizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy. An additional post hoc analysis showed no significant differences in PFS or OS between PD-L1 50-89% and ≥ 90% subgroups in the tislelizumab plus chemotherapy arm. The safety profile of tislelizumab plus chemotherapy was manageable and consistent with previous analyses.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced nsq-NSCLC and PD-L1 tumor cell expression ≥ 50%, first-line tislelizumab plus chemotherapy demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and OS versus chemotherapy. Efficacy was consistent across subgroups of patients with high PD-L1 tumor cell expression levels (50-89% and ≥ 90%).\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov NCT03663205."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Subcutaneous (SC) formulations of oncology therapies could provide time-saving benefits for both patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) compared with intravenous (IV) delivery. This prospective observational study, conducted alongside the MK-3475A-D77 phase 3, open-label randomized clinical trial, quantifies HCP and patient time with pembrolizumab SC versus pembrolizumab IV among patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nMETHODS: Seventeen sites across eight countries in Europe (n = 4), South America (n = 3), and Asia (n = 1) were enrolled. Primary endpoints were active HCP time; patient time in the treatment chair, treatment room, and healthcare facility; and consumables usage. Descriptive statistics included weighted mean (WM), and a linear mixed model (LMM) was employed to explore differences in time measures between pembrolizumab SC and pembrolizumab IV per visit.\n\nRESULTS: Overall, 212 observations were analyzed (153 SC and 59 IV). Total active HCP time was reduced by 45.6% with SC versus IV (WM, 14.0 vs 25.8 min); HCPs spent 44.3% less time on the drug preparation process with SC versus IV (WM, 5.1 vs 9.1 min) and 46.3% less time on the drug administration process with SC versus IV (WM, 8.9 vs 16.7 min). Patient chair time was reduced by 49.6% with SC versus IV (WM, 59.0 vs 117.2 min). Patients receiving SC spent less time in the treatment room than those receiving IV (WM, 66.7 vs 126.9 min; difference - 47.4%). Exploratory LMM showed considerable between-group differences for active HCP time and patient time in the treatment chair and treatment room.\n\nCONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab SC substantially reduces active HCP time and patient chair time versus pembrolizumab IV. Time liberated for HCPs could be reallocated toward additional patient care activities, while optimized chair utilization could improve overall healthcare efficiency."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major adverse prognostic factor with heterogeneous outcomes across tumor types. We aimed to describe the characteristics of lung cancer patients with VTE, compare outcomes across malignancies, and assess their association with complications, progression, and survival.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed TESEO-SEOM, a prospective multicenter registry including patients with active cancer and VTE. Patients were stratified by tumor site, with lung as reference. Outcomes included recurrent VTE, bleeding, and survival. Analyses were stratified by tumor type and VTE presentation (clinically suspected, symptomatic/asymptomatic incidental). Complications were estimated using competing-risk methods.\n\nRESULTS: Among 3855 patients, the most frequent cancers were gastrointestinal (39.4 %), lung (22.2 %), and breast (10.4 %). Pulmonary embolism predominated (55 %), especially in lung cancer (69.8 %). Overall, 48.9 % of events were clinically suspected and 50.9 % incidental; suspected were more common in lung cancer (53.9 %), whereas incidental diagnoses predominated in gastrointestinal tumors (58.8 %). Complications occurred in 17.6 % (10.2 % bleeding, 7.4 % recurrent VTE). Recurrence was highest in gastrointestinal cancers (11.4 %, Gray's p = 0.022), while bleeding did not differ (p = 0.213). VTE-related mortality was low (1 %), while mixed-cause mortality was highest in lung cancer (17.2 %). Median PFS and OS were shortest in lung cancer (4.5 and 7.7 months, p < 0.0001). Incidental asymptomatic events conferred longer survival, particularly in lung cancer (OS 11.5 vs. 7.3 months for symptomatic incidental and 5.6 for suspected, p < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION: VTE in lung cancer is associated with more severe presentation, higher mixed-cause mortality, and worse survival than in other tumors. Incidental asymptomatic VTE predicts better outcomes, supporting risk stratification by tumor type and presentation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate staging of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential to determine further management. Current guidelines recommend confirmatory mediastinoscopy for patients with suspicious mediastinal lymph node metastases in image-based staging but negative findings on endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). In clinical practice, adherence to these recommendations is low and many physicians omit invasive surgical staging. This study aimed to assess the results of subsequent video-assisted mediastinoscopic lymphadenectomy (VAMLA).\n\nMETHODS: Retrospective single-center cohort analysis of patients who underwent surgery between 2015 and 2019. All patients were diagnosed with potentially resectable lung cancer or FDG-avid pulmonary nodule suspicious for NSCLC and underwent VAMLA following N0-N2 EBUS-TBNA for mediastinal staging.\n\nRESULTS: VAMLA was performed in 228 patients. Nodal upstaging after EBUS-TBNA occurred in 17.5 % of the cases (n = 40). During EBUS-TBNA, 1.72 (±1.06) lymph node stations were sampled, compared to 5.59 (±1.1) resected stations in VAMLA (p < 0.001). Clinical nodal status staged by PET/CT was significantly correlated with the occurrence of nodal upstaging by VAMLA, with an odds ratio of 7.69 in cN2 and 5.88 in patients with cN3, compared to cN0. Complications occurred in 8 patients (3.59 %). VAMLA was false negative in 1 patient (0.4 %).\n\nCONCLUSION: Subsequent VAMLA enables the accurate staging of patients after negative EBUS-TBNA. Overall, 17.5 % of cases had nodal upstaging and would otherwise not have received guideline-compliant treatment for NSCLC. These results underline the role of surgical mediastinal staging after negative EBUS-TBNA in patients with suspicious radiologic findings."

      "abstract": "The objective of this research is to investigate the association between occupational radon exposure and pulmonary health outcomes in male miners from Chongqing, China. Between June 2022 and December 2023, 110 miners were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Personal radon exposure levels were measured using passive cumulative dosimeters, with pulmonary health assessed through radiologist-interpreted low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans and serum biomarker analysis (CEA, CYFRA21-1, NSE, and CA125) via ELISA. Multivariable analyses revealed strong dose-response relationships between radon exposure and both serum biomarkers and CT abnormalities. high radon exposure predicted substantial biomarker elevations including a 2.45-fold increase in CYFRA21-1 (β = 0.39, 95 % CI 0.25-0.54, p < 0.001), 1.60-fold increase in CEA (β = 0.20, 0.05-0.35, p = 0.008), and 3.58-fold increased CT abnormality risk (OR = 3.58, p = 0.023). Mediation analysis identified CYFRA21-1 as accounting for 69 % (p = 0.024) and CEA for 24.7 % (p = 0.036) of radon's effect on CT abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that occupational radon exposure contributes to pulmonary damage through both direct effects and biomarker-mediated pathways, with CYFRA21-1 and CEA emerging as potential early indicators of lung cancer in radon-exposed populations."

We evaluated the benefit of first-line pembrolizumab with platinum-etoposide in chemo-sensitive ED-SCLC.\n\nMETHODS: REACTION is a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II trial. Eligible patients (responders after 2 cycles of platinum-etoposide) were randomized 1:1 to experimental arm pembrolizumab in combination with 4 cycles of platinum-etoposide then pembrolizumab vs platinum-etoposide in the control arm. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) were enumerated and their association with PFS and OS was investigated.\n\nRESULTS: Between Feb 7, 2018 and Oct 31, 2019, 125 patients were recruited (61 vs 64 experimental and control arms respectively) with 119 (58 vs 61) eligible and receiving at least one dose of treatment. Baseline characteristics were median age 65 vs 63.5 years, PS 1 (62 vs 60 %), and brain metastases (8 vs 11 %), in the experimental and control arms respectively. Amongst 124 patients who started treatment, 46 (37 %) experienced adverse events grade ≥ 3 for pembrolizumab arm vs 26 % in the control arm. Response rate was 61 % (67 vs 56 %). Median PFS (95 % CI) was 4.7 months (4.2, 5.6) vs 5.4 (4.7, 5.6), HR (80 % CI) = 0.84 (0.65, 1.09) and 1-sided p = 0.194. Median OS (95 % CI) was 12.3 months (8.9, 14.8) vs 10.4 (8.2, 12.2), HR (80 % CI) = 0.73 (0.54, 1.0) and 1-sided p = 0.097. CTC count per 7.5 ml blood at randomization was associated significantly with both PFS and OS regardless of treatment arms.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab added to platinum-etoposide did not improve PFS over platinum-etoposide alone in chemo-sensitive patients with ED."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low-dose chest CT screening can reduce lung cancer mortality through early diagnosis. Several studies suggest that risk prediction models are more efficient than categorical age and smoking criteria for participant selection, but there are still reservations from policy makers about their implementation. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of a predefined PLCOm2012 model threshold with the categorical NELSON risk criteria.\n\nMETHODS: In this ongoing prospective cohort study, current or former smokers aged 55-79 years who met either NELSON risk criteria or had a PLCOm2012 6-year risk of at least 1·58% were recruited from three certified German lung cancer centres in Großhansdorf, Hannover, and Lübeck, and received low-dose CT at baseline and 1-year follow-up screening rounds, including all downstream follow-up procedures. The PLCOm2012 cutoff point of at least 1·58% was predefined and estimated to result in an equal group size as with the NELSON inclusion criteria. The primary outcome was the comparison of the positive predictive values for lung cancers detected in PLCOm2012-selected versus NELSON-selected groups. Here, we report the final results of the primary analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04913155.\n\nFINDINGS: Between July 23, 2021, and Aug 19, 2022 (end of recruitment), 5191 participants (2208 [43·5%] female, 2983 [57·5%] male, and 5076 [97·8%] of European White ethnicity) who met either one or both high-risk criteria were enrolled (4167 PLCOm2012-selected vs 3916 NELSON-selected participants) and underwent the baseline low-dose CT scan. In the observation period between the two low-dose CT screening rounds (mean volume CT dose index 1·15 mGy [SD 0·15]) with a median time interval of 1·05 years (IQR 0·95-1·08), 111 lung cancers were detected. The positive predictive value (lung cancer detection rate) in the PLCOm2012-selected group was 108 of 4167 participants (2·59% [95% CI 2·13-3·12]) compared with 85 of 3916 participants (2·17% [1·74-2·68]) in the NELSON-selected group (p=0·0016), resulting in a lower number needed to screen (38·6 [32·1-46·9] vs 46·1 [37·3-57·5]).\n\nINTERPRETATION: Participant selection using the PLCOm2012 risk prediction model with a 6-year risk of at least 1·58% cutoff is more efficient and effective in detecting lung cancer than the NELSON criteria and should therefore be implemented in lung cancer screening programmes.\n\nFUNDING: Federal Ministry of Education and Research (German Center for Lung Research) and AstraZeneca."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and lung cancer risk has attracted considerable clinical attention, but conclusions remain inconsistent due to confounding factors such as smoking, and previous studies have paid less attention to specific histological subtypes. This study aims to systematically elucidate the complex relationship between the two through an evidence triangulation strategy combining large-scale clinical cohort studies, machine learning risk prediction, and genetic causal inference.\n\nMETHODS: This study adopted an evidence triangulation strategy, integrating evidence from different populations and methods. First layer of evidence (clinical association, Chinese population): We conducted 1:1 propensity score matching analysis on a real-world cohort of 8,867 subjects (4,661 RA patients) (2014-2024, First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine), with particular focus on the association between RA and different lung cancer subtypes (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma). We also built machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost) based on 22 clinical features from this cohort to explore the feasibility of individualized risk prediction for overall lung cancer. Second layer of evidence (genetic causation, European population): We turned to use completely independent large-scale public GWAS summary data (RA: N = 92,044, European ancestry; squamous cell lung cancer: N = 63,053, European ancestry; smoking: N = 111,752, European ancestry), employing multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analysis, after adjusting for the genetic effects of smoking, to specifically explore the causal effect of RA on squamous cell lung cancer.\n\nRESULTS: Clinical evidence reveals that the association between RA and lung cancer exhibits significant subtype specificity: after matching, RA significantly increases squamous cell lung cancer risk (adjusted OR = 2.415, 95% CI: 1.104-5.283, P = 0.027), but shows no significant association with adenocarcinoma (P = 0.437) or small cell carcinoma (P = 0.564). Machine learning models based on clinical features showed limited predictive ability (AUC = 0.57-0.68), revealing the challenge of translating population associations into individual predictions. In an independent European population, genetic analysis presents an instructive paradox: preliminary univariable MR analysis shows RA has a genetic protective effect on squamous cell lung cancer (OR = 0.985), while linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) shows no significant genetic correlation between the two (rg = -0.019, P = 0.806). After simultaneously adjusting for the genetic effects of smoking in multivariable MR analysis, the causal promoting effect of RA on squamous cell lung cancer was revealed (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00-1.04, P = 0.046), explaining that the apparent protective effect observed in univariable analysis was actually caused by smoking confounding.\n\nCONCLUSION: RA specifically increases squamous cell lung cancer (but not other subtypes) risk. Multivariable Mendelian randomization resolves the causal paradox caused by smoking confounding. Clinical evidence (China) and genetic evidence (Europe) come from different populations and require further validation. Results support implementation of targeted squamous cell lung cancer screening for high-risk RA patients."

We aimed to evaluate the combination of an immune checkpoint inhibitor with platinum-based therapy in this population.\n\nMETHODS: This open-label, single-arm phase 2 NEJ045A trial enrolled untreated patients with extensive-stage SCLC with performance status 2 or 3. Participants received four cycles of durvalumab, carboplatin, and etoposide, followed by durvalumab maintenance. A dose adjustment strategy was used, with initial reductions in carboplatin-etoposide dosages, subsequently adjusted based on adverse events, allowing for potential escalation. The primary endpoint was tolerability, assessed by the proportion of patients completing induction therapy. A key secondary endpoint was 1-year survival rate. This trial is registered at the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs031200319) and has been completed.\n\nFINDINGS: Between April 8, 2021, and Oct 3, 2023, 57 patients (performance status 2 n=43 and performance status 3 n=14) were enrolled with a median age of 73·5 years (IQR 69·0-77·5), 44 (79%) of 56 were male. 26 (67%; 80% CI 55·2-76·7; p<0·0001) of 39 patients with performance status 2 and five (50%; 26·7-73·3; p=0·0088) of ten with performance status 3 completed induction therapy, exceeding the pre-specified threshold. Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 52 (93%) of 56 patients, and 12 (21%) of 56 discontinued due to adverse events.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Checkpoint inhibitors, including combinations with standard-of-care chemotherapy, have shown survival benefit in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, access to these drugs varies. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the PD-1 inhibitor retifanlimab plus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment for non-squamous or squamous metastatic NSCLC.\n\nMETHODS: POD1UM-304 was a phase 3, multiregional, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised study conducted in approximately 124 hospitals and private clinical centres in 16 countries. Male and female adults aged 18 years or older with squamous or non-squamous stage IV NSCLC (staging by American Joint Committee on Cancer version 8) with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1 and no previous systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) using interactive response technology to receive intravenous retifanlimab 375 mg or matching placebo on day 1 of each 21-day cycle plus standard platinum-based chemotherapy according to tumour histology for up to 2 years. Patients with non-squamous NSCLC received pemetrexed 500 mg/m\n\nFINDINGS: Between Sept 11, 2020, and March 14, 2023, 1388 patients were assessed for eligibility, 583 of whom were randomly assigned to retifanlimab plus chemotherapy (n=391) or placebo plus chemotherapy (n=192). 381 (65%) patients had non-squamous NSCLC and 202 (35%) had squamous NSCLC; 467 (80%) patients were male and 116 (20%) were female. Median age was 64 years (IQR 58-68). Median overall survival was longer in the retifanlimab plus chemotherapy group than in the placebo plus chemotherapy group (18·1 months [95% CI 16·2-21·0] vs 13·4 months [11·0-16·7]; hazard ratio 0·75 [95% CI 0·60-0·93]; p=0·0042). Overall, higher incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events that were serious (158 [41%] of 389 vs 57 [30%] of 190), grade 3 or worse (238 [61%] vs 103 [54%]), or led to retifanlimab or placebo dose delay (169 [43%] vs 67 [35%]) or discontinuation (33 [8%] vs nine [5%]) were observed in the retifanlimab plus chemotherapy group than in the placebo plus chemotherapy group. The proportions of fatal COVID-19-related treatment-emergent adverse events were similar in the retifanlimab plus chemotherapy group and the placebo plus chemotherapy group (four [1%] vs five [3%]).\n\nINTERPRETATION: Retifanlimab improved overall survival compared with placebo when added to platinum-based chemotherapy, with a safety profile that is representative of previous PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor-chemotherapy combinations. Adding retifanlimab to first-line chemotherapy could be a potential treatment option for patients with squamous or non-squamous metastatic NSCLC.\n\nFUNDING: Incyte."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy is widely provided to control menopausal symptoms and has been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women. This is an updated version of a Cochrane review first published in 2005.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the long-term effects of prolonged use (at least one year) of hormone therapy on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, fractures and cognition in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.\n\nSEARCH METHODS: We used the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, three other databases and two trial registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify the studies included in the review. The latest search date was 26 September 2024.\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised, double-blind trials in which peri- or postmenopausal women took hormone therapy or placebo for at least one year. We included various oestrogen formulations, with or without progestogens. We focused on studies assessing hormone therapy's effects on long-term clinical outcomes, including death, coronary events and cancer. Hormone therapy's efficacy in managing menopausal symptoms was beyond the scope of this review, and is assessed in other Cochrane reviews.\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.\n\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 24 studies - with two newly added in this update - involving 45,660 participants. We derived nearly 70% of the data from two well-conducted studies: the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS 1998) and the large, multi-component Women's Health Initiative research programme, which included two hormone therapy arms (WHI 1998). Across all the studies, most participants were postmenopausal American women with one or more comorbidities. The mean participant age in most studies was over 60 years. Only one included study focused on perimenopausal women. We present full results for all included studies with available data in the main review. The results presented below are drawn from WHI 1998, in which the combined hormone therapy arm and the oestrogen-only arm were run concurrently, with women assigned to the appropriate trial based on their uterus status. One study with 16,608 postmenopausal women with an intact uterus compared combined continuous hormone therapy (conjugated equine oestrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate) to placebo, and measured outcomes at an average of 5.6 years of follow-up. Based on this study, combined continuous hormone therapy probably makes little to no difference to the risk of a coronary event (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44; moderate-certainty evidence). It may increase the risk of stroke (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.09; low-certainty evidence) and venous thromboembolism (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.55 to 6.64; low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, combined continuous hormone therapy probably increases the risk of breast cancer (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.56; moderate-certainty evidence) and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of lung cancer (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.46; moderate-certainty evidence). It may increase gallbladder disease requiring surgery (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.06; 14,203 participants; low-certainty evidence), and probably reduces the risk of all clinical fractures (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.86; moderate-certainty evidence). One study including 10,739 postmenopausal women who had undergone a hysterectomy compared oestrogen-only (conjugated equine oestrogen) hormone therapy to placebo, and measured outcomes at an average of seven years' follow-up. Based on this study, oestrogen-only hormone therapy probably makes little to no difference to the risk of coronary events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.13), venous thromboembolism (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.74) and breast cancer (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.01), all with moderate-certainty evidence. It may make little to no difference to the risk of lung cancer (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.48; low-certainty evidence). Oestrogen-only hormone therapy probably increases the risk of stroke (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.67) and gallbladder disease requiring surgery (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.24), and probably reduces the risk of all clinical fractures (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.80), all with moderate-certainty evidence. We judged most included studies to have a low risk of bias for most domains. The overall certainty of evidence for the main comparisons was moderate. The main limitation was that only about 30% of women were 50 to 59 years old at baseline, the age group most likely to consider hormone therapy for vasomotor symptoms.\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up of women using hormone therapy suggests that the risk profiles vary between combined hormone therapy and oestrogen-only therapy. Oestrogen-only hormone therapy probably makes little to no difference to coronary events, and probably increases the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease. It probably makes little to no difference in the risk of breast cancer, and probably reduces the risk of all fractures. Combined hormone therapy may increase the risk of thromboembolism and probably increases the risk of breast cancer. These results should be interpreted with caution as they are based on one study using oral hormone therapy, which may not represent the risks of the hormone therapy currently used in clinical practice."
