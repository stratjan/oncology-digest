      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have dramatically improved outcomes for patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but relapse frequently occurs because of drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells that can evolve and develop diverse mechanisms of drug resistance. In samples from patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting, we observed enriched expression of the cell surface protein TROP2, a target of clinically active antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). We confirmed these findings across multiple EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell line and patient-derived xenograft models treated with osimertinib in vivo. Treatment with the TROP2 ADC sacituzumab govitecan at the time of osimertinib-induced minimal residual disease only modestly delayed tumor recurrence in vivo, whereas a single infusion of sacituzumab-based TROP2-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells significantly prolonged relapse-free survival, with evidence of cure. These data highlight the potential of engineering TROP2 CAR T-cell therapy to eliminate EGFR DTPs in patients.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: We provide a rationale for targeting TROP2 in EGFR-mutated NSCLC DTPs. In contrast to TROP2 ADC therapy, targeting of TROP2 with CAR-T cells can eliminate osimertinib-induced DTPs in vivo, revealing the promise of developing novel TROP2-based CAR-T cells to promote durable response and prevent disease relapse in patients."

      "abstract": "Acquisition of resistance to anti-cancer therapies is a multistep process initiated by the survival of drug-tolerant persister cells. Accessibility of drug-tolerant persister cells in patients is limited, which has hindered understanding the mechanisms driving their emergence. Here, using multiple patient-derived models to isolate persister cells, we showed that these cells are transcriptionally plastic in vivo and return to a common treatment naïve-like state upon relapse, regardless of treatment. Hallmarks of the persister state in TNBC across treatment modalities included high expression of basal keratins together with activation of stress response and inflammation pathways. These hallmarks were also activated in HER2+ breast and lung cancer cells in response to targeted therapies. Analysis of gene regulatory networks identified AP-1, NF-κB and IRF/STAT as the key drivers of this hallmark persister state. Functionally, FOSL1, an AP-1 member, drove cells to the persister state by binding enhancers and reprogramming the transcriptome of cancer cells. On the contrary, cancer cells without FOSL1 had a decreased ability to reach the persister state. By defining hallmarks of TNBC persistence on multiple therapies, this study provides a resource to design effective combination therapeutic strategies that limit resistance."

      "abstract": "EGFR mutations are common oncogenic drivers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and around one-third of patients develop brain metastases over the course of their disease. Patients with non-classical EGFR mutations, such as insertions in exon 20, are a high unmet need with a worse prognosis compared to patients with classical EGFR mutations. Here, we describe the discovery and development of enozertinib (formerly ORIC-114), a highly brain-penetrant, orally bioavailable, irreversible inhibitor that targets EGFR exon 20 mutations with unparalleled kinome selectivity. Preclinical studies revealed strong potency and tumor regressions driven by enozertinib across a broad range of atypical EGFR mutant models. In a phase I clinical trial of enozertinib in patients with advanced NSCLC bearing atypical mutations in EGFR, a patient with harboring an EGFR exon 20 insertion experienced sustained complete response of all systemic and brain metastases. Together, these findings identify enozertinib as a promising investigational inhibitor to meet the unmet need for brain-penetrant therapies for NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertions or other atypical mutations."

      "abstract": "The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer (LC) screening trial (Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek [NELSON]) demonstrated low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduces LC mortality by 24% among men. The NELSON protocol differed from previous trials in the eligibility criteria, the use of volume-based nodule management, and increasing screening intervals. The early-stage sensitivity of the protocol is pivotal in determining the optimal screening strategy, such as the interval and age range. The MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis-Lung natural history model was used to reproduce LC incidence and mortality by detection method (clinical or screen-detected), sex, histology, and stage in the NELSON trial based on individual-level data. We evaluated screening effectiveness by stage and histology, accounting for population characteristics, trial design, and LC epidemiology. We find stage IA non-small cell LC (NSCLC) sensitivity of 24.6% (other NSCLC) to 41.0% (adenocarcinoma) at baseline screening. At repeat screening rounds, we find this increased to 70.9% for stage IA adenocarcinoma. For stage IB, the sensitivity by histology ranges from 26.4% to 77.1%; for stage II, 39.6%-81.9%. Upon detection, the probability of LC mortality prevention is estimated at 83% for stage IA. The sensitivity for detecting early-stage LC is found to depend on the histology of cancer and is increased for adenocarcinoma at repeat screenings. Despite a low rate of referral to follow-up screening in the NELSON trial, early-stage CT sensitivity and the probability of mortality prevention were similar to previous estimates from the National Lung cancer Screening Trial. Previously demonstrated screening effectiveness may be maintained when implementing new programs, while reducing unnecessary follow-up when considering NELSON evidence."

We report an exploratory analysis in patients enrolled in Japan. Patients received durvalumab 1500 mg (N = 264), durvalumab+tremelimumab 75 mg (4 doses, N = 200; arm remained blinded), or placebo (N = 266) every 4 weeks for ≤ 24 months. Prior cCRT ± prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was per local standards of care. In the Japan subgroup, 19 and 31 patients received durvalumab and placebo, respectively; prior cCRT comprised cisplatin-etoposide/carboplatin-etoposide in 94.7/5.3% and 87.1/12.9% and once-daily/twice-daily radiotherapy in 10.5/89.5% and 0/100%; 52.6% and 58.1% received PCI. Median OS was not reached versus 44.9 months (3-year OS 67.4% versus 58.1%; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.24-1.62). Median PFS by BICR was 44.2 versus 29.4 months (24-month PFS 59.6% vs. 58.6%; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.44-2.36); median PFS by investigator assessment (sensitivity analysis) was 44.2 versus 19.7 months (24-month PFS 65.6% vs. 47.0%; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.28-1.51). With durvalumab and placebo, 21.1% and 19.4% had maximum grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs), 21.1% and 9.7% had AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and 52.6% and 45.2% had pneumonitis/radiation pneumonitis (grade 3-4: 0% and 6.5%). In conclusion, consolidation durvalumab demonstrated a favorable risk/benefit profile in Japanese patients with LS-SCLC post cCRT. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03703297."

However, the complete clinical benefit of first-line amivantamab-chemotherapy is not fully understood, nor is the survival advantage in the presence of per-protocol crossover from chemotherapy to amivantamab after progression.\n\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) and time to subsequent therapy (TTST), at the time of primary analysis for progression-free survival, and the effect of the crossover design on overall survival at the time of interim analysis.\n\nMETHODS: In the phase III PAPILLON study, 308 participants were randomized (amivantamab-chemotherapy, n = 153; chemotherapy, n = 155). Intravenous amivantamab was administered every 3 weeks. Chemotherapy was administered as carboplatin for four cycles and pemetrexed until disease progression. TTD and TTST were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Crossover-adjusted survival estimates were generated using three established statistical methods.\n\nRESULTS: At a median follow-up of 14.9 months, median TTD was 13.2 versus 7.5 months for amivantamab-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.38 [95% confidence interval 0.28-0.51]; nominal p < 0.0001). Median TTST was 17.7 versus 9.9 months (HR 0.35 [95% confidence interval 0.25-0.49]; nominal p < 0.0001). A total of 65/155 participants crossed over from chemotherapy to amivantamab after progression. The crossover-adjusted overall survival continued to demonstrate a favorable survival benefit for amivantamab-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy with HRs of 0.52-0.60, which is more pronounced than the planned interim intention-to-treat overall survival (HR of 0.67; 95% confidence interval 0.42-1.09).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In PAPILLON, TTD and TTST were substantially longer for amivantamab-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy at primary analysis (cut-off on 3 May 2023). Crossover-adjusted analyses of the planned interim overall survival demonstrated a greater benefit for amivantamab-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy, further supporting amivantamab-chemotherapy as the first-line standard of care in EGFR exon 20 insertion-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04538664."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: EGFR-mutated (EGFRm) NSCLC is associated with high incidence of brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease (LMD), for which effective systemic options beyond osimertinib 80 and 160 mg daily are limited. While there is some evidence for high-dose pulse administration of earlier-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFK-TKIs), data for pulse-dose osimertinib are limited.\n\nMETHODS: This multicenter retrospective case series included patients with EGFRm NSCLC with LMD or parenchymal brain metastases treated with pulse-dose osimertinib (400-560 mg once every 5-7 days) for central nervous system (CNS) progression, with or without other concurrent therapies. CNS disease control was defined as the interval from pulse-dose osimertinib initiation to radiographic progression or discontinuation for clinical progression, whichever was shorter.\n\nRESULTS: Among 14 patients, EGFR mutations included exon 19 deletion in 6, L858R in 6, and other mutations in 4. All had received previous EGFR-TKI including 5 with prior osimertinib 160 mg daily. Seven received pulse-dose osimertinib as monotherapy, while the remainder received it in combination with other systemic therapy and/or CNS radiation. No treatment-related severe or unexpected side effects were reported, and only 1 patient required dose modification for adverse events. Median duration of CNS control was 4.0 months (95% CI, 1.8-NR) and median overall survival was 6.2 months (95% CI, 3.2-NR), with benefit driven by patients without previous osimertinib 160 mg daily exposure.\n\nCONCLUSION: Though further pharmacokinetic investigation is warranted, this report provides preliminary evidence that pulse-dose osimertinib may be a safe regimen among patients with EGFRm NSCLC and refractory CNS disease."

Aim of this analysis is to provide end-of-study results from the phase IIIb MAURIS study on the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in the same disease setting, in a patient population with broader inclusion criteria.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: MAURIS is a multicentric, open-label, single-arm study conducted between 2019 and 2023 in 25 Italian study centres. A total of 155 patients with untreated ES-SCLC were enrolled. Treatment was based on atezolizumab 1200 mg + carboplatin + etoposide every 21 days, for 4 to 6 cycles, during the induction phase, and atezolizumab every 3 weeks during the maintenance phase. Safety, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were among study endpoints.\n\nRESULTS: The median OS at end of study was 10.6 months, with OS rates of 45.5% at 1 year, 31.0% at 1.5 years, 17.1% at 2 years and 14.5% at 3 years. The median PFS was 5.5 months. Serious adverse events (AEs) occurred in 38.3% of patients, treatment-related serious AEs in 21.4%, and immuno-mediated treatment-emergent AEs in 26.6% of patients. Immune-mediated grade 3 to 4 AEs were inversely related with mortality (hazard ratio, HR = 0.36; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.13-0.97) in a multivariate analysis.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study showed consistent findings with the IMpower133 trial on the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. Long-term survival of a subgroup of patients was also confirmed."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 [ERBB2]) gene mutations occur in ∼3-5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and are associated with poor prognosis. However, real-world data on patients with HER2-mutant (HER2m) NSCLC are needed.\n\nMETHODS: This retrospective, observational study evaluated characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of patients with advanced nonsquamous HER2m NSCLC from the Institut Curie (France) and Thoraxklinik Heidelberg (Germany) between 2011 and 2022.\n\nFINDINGS: Of the 55 patients (Curie: n = 17; Heidelberg: n = 38) included in the study, median age at diagnosis was 66 years (range, 22-90), 63.6% were female, and 50.9% had no history of smoking. Forty-eight (87.3%) patients received ≥1 line of therapy, 29 (52.7%) received ≥2 lines of therapy, and 19 (34.5%) received ≥3 lines of therapy. The most common first-line treatment was platinum-based and non-platinum-based chemotherapy (54.2%, n/n = 26/48); treatment patterns in the second- and third-line settings were more diverse than in the first-line setting. Median overall survival was 14.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.2, 23.2; n = 55) from the diagnosis of advanced disease and 16.5 months (12.3, 29.8; n = 48) from the start of first-line treatment. Median progression-free survival was 5.1 months (95% CI 3.5, 8.5; n = 48) and 4.0 months (2.4, 6.3; n = 29) from the start of first- and second-line treatment, respectively.\n\nIMPLICATIONS: Patients with advanced HER2m NSCLC had a poor prognosis despite treatment with standard-of-care regimens available during the study period. These findings highlight the need for novel therapeutic options to improve clinical outcomes for patients with HER2m NSCLC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to characterize the association between pulmonary embolism (PE) onset time and various antitumor therapeutic approaches in patients with lung cancer, with the goal of identifying potential high-risk populations.\n\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical records from 2019 to 2025, among the 84,000 inpatients with lung cancer, 106 patients developed PE during hospitalization for antitumor treatment, who were confirmed using spiral computed tomography or pulmonary angiography per Chinese Thoracic Society (2018) and The New England Journal of Medicine (2010) criteria. Data were collected on patient demographics, cancer staging, treatment type, and time to PE onset.\n\nRESULTS: Among patients who developed PE during lung cancer treatment, the mean age was 66.82 ± 10.50 years. Females comprised 64.04% of cases, adenocarcinoma was identified in 60.38%, and stage IV lung cancer was present in 56.60%. First-line therapy was administered in 63.21% of cases, and 66.04% exhibited enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. The mean D-dimer level among this cohort was 3.559 μg/mL, indicating a heightened thrombotic risk. Temporally, 50.95% of PE cases occurred within 6 months of lung cancer diagnosis. Onset within 3 months following therapy initiation was observed across multiple modalities: 46.15% for chemotherapy, 34.78% for targeted therapy, and 77.78% following surgical intervention. Notably, 16.98% of PE events occurred during the initial chemotherapy cycle. The mean time to PE onset was 1.81 ± 2.51 months for patients undergoing surgery alone, compared to 15.52 ± 12.88 months for those receiving surgery combined with other treatments (P < 0.05). Surgical intervention was identified as an independent risk factor for PE. In early-stage lung cancer, the mean time to PE onset was significantly shorter, with a mean time of 16.38 ± 21.07 months (P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION: The timing and incidence of PE vary according to the type of antitumor therapy administered in lung cancer treatment. These findings underscore the importance of vigilant monitoring, personalized risk assessment, and targeted anticoagulation strategies throughout the therapeutic course."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend cisplatin as the preferred platinum agent in the first-line treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), especially limited-stage disease (LS-SCLC). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, carboplatin use likely increased due to logistical advantages. We evaluated the pandemic's impact on platinum agent utilization in the Netherlands and compared overall survival (OS) and safety between cisplatin and carboplatin.\n\nMETHODS: Using Netherlands Cancer Registry data, first-line platinum-based treatments for LS-SCLC and extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) between 2018 and 2023 were analyzed. OS was evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses. Grades 3-5 treatment-related adverse events were studied in three hospitals.\n\nFINDINGS: Overall, 1683 LS-SCLC (carboplatin, N = 1011[60 %]; cisplatin, N = 672[40 %]) and 3668 ES-SCLC (carboplatin, N = 3002[82 %]; cisplatin, N = 666[18 %]) patients were included. During the pandemic, quarterly usage rates of carboplatin reached up to 81 % and 90 % in LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC, respectively. In LS-SCLC, univariable analysis showed significantly shorter median OS with carboplatin compared to cisplatin (17.9m vs. 26.3m; HR, 1.48; 95 %CI, 1.31-1.68; p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in ES-SCLC (8.0m vs. 9.3m; HR, 1.19; 95 %CI, 1.09-1.30; p < 0.001). However, multivariable analyses, after adjusting for confounders, showed no significant OS differences in either LS-SCLC (HR, 1.06; 95 %CI, 0.90-1.25; p = 0.463) or ES-SCLC (HR, 1.01; 95 %CI, 0.92-1.12; p = 0.785). Confounders were performance status (PS), age, sex, and chemoradiotherapy type for LS-SCLC, and PS, age, sex, stage, and liver metastases for ES-SCLC. Hematologic toxicity was higher with carboplatin, while cisplatin led to more nonhematologic toxicity.\n\nINTERPRETATION: These findings challenge the long-standing belief of cisplatin's superiority and support the adoption of carboplatin in SCLC."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Young adults are a minority of lung cancer (LC) patients, however, clinical presentation and cancer biology can differ. Here, we report the first German cohort study of young adults with LC.\n\nMETHODS: We included patients diagnosed with LC between 2019 and 2023 at the West German Cancer Centre (University Medicine Essen) in this retrospective cohort study. For analysis of clinicogenomic baseline characteristics and overall survival (OS), patients were stratified by age at diagnosis into a young cohort (YC; n = 56, ≤45 years), an older cohort (OC; n = 2.682, >45 years) and analysed across age decades.\n\nRESULTS: 71 of 2.738 patients with LC (2.59 %) were ≤ 45 years old. 56/71 were diagnosed with NSCLC or SCLC. YC frequently reported no history of smoking (21 % vs. 6 %; p < 0.001). Among YC, adenocarcinoma (59 % vs. 49 %) and NSCLC not-otherwise-specified (NSCLC NOS; 27 % vs. 8.2 %) were the dominant histological subtypes (p < 0.001). Stage IV disease was significantly more common in YC (stage IV: 66 % vs. 44 %; p = 0.005) with more frequent regional lymph node involvement (N1-N3 79 % vs. 56.9 %) and extrathoracic lymph node metastases (38 % vs. 14 %; p < 0.001). Frequent targetable genomic alterations in YC included ALK translocations (21 % vs. 2.2 %; p < 0.001). YC with metastatic NSCLC had similar median OS compared to OC, although OS was improved in those with targetable alterations.\n\nCONCLUSION: Early-onset LC is characterized by advanced disease stage, adenocarcinoma histopathology and frequent targetable genomic alterations, especially in patients without a history of smoking. Early diagnosis remains a critical unmet medical need in this subgroup of patients."

The aim of this study is to provide an up-to-date analysis on toxicities and outcomes associated with definitive radiation therapy (RT) in patients with ILD and early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC).\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception until June 2024, for studies including patients with ILD who underwent definitive RT alone for ES-NSCLC. Data including treatment-related mortality, toxicity, local control, and overall survival were collected and analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Of 3545 records reviewed, 24 studies were identified for full data abstraction, contributing a total of 705 patients. A specific ILD subtype was not reported for 71% (n = 502) of patients. ILD severity was not reported for 62% (n = 440) of patients. Risk of treatment-related mortality was 7.9%, with severe treatment-related respiratory toxicity 15.7%. A higher volume of lung receiving ≥5 Gy (V5) was significantly correlated with mortality. The estimated local control at 3 year was 76% and median overall survival was 2.5 years.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The relative merits of RT for the treatment of ES-NSCLC in patients with ILD should be considered in the context of the rates of treatment-related mortality and toxicity. Future studies would benefit from consistent reporting of ILD characteristics, which may help in risk stratification in this challenging clinical scenario."

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of longitudinal tumour dynamics, time-varying drug-related adverse events (DRAEs), and other clinical characteristics on long-term outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). An ambispective cohort of 277 patients was analysed and externally validated using independent clinical trial data from 470 patients in the Project Data Sphere. Individual tumour growth trajectories were characterised by predicted sum of the longest diameters (SLD) using tumour growth inhibition (TGI) modelling. Time-dependent Cox and parametric time-to-event models were then applied to evaluate the influence of predicted tumour growth trajectories, observed dynamic DRAE profiles, cross-sectional variables derived from these measures, and additional covariates on time-to-treatment failure (TTF) and progression-free survival (PFS). The TGI models effectively captured individual tumour dynamics. Across both Cox and parametric time-to-event models, prognostic factors consistently included DRAEs, baseline metastasis, EGFR-TKI treatment history, and the specific EGFR-TKI administered. Notably, grade 2 DRAEs were associated with an optimal balance between efficacy and safety, and this association remained robust in sensitivity analyses and was preliminarily validated using external data. These findings emphasise the clinical relevance of DRAE grades in indicating long-term clinical benefit. By linking manageable toxicity with durable therapeutic outcomes, the study provides valuable insights for developing safe and effective EGFR-TKI treatment strategies in patients with NSCLC."

There are no clear guidelines for managing lung cancer patients with ILD undergoing RT, alone or with systemic therapies. This work aims to establish a consensus on ILD assessment, patient selection, risk/benefit analysis, and clinical management for those eligible for thoracic RT.\n\nMETHODS: Using the Estimate-Talk-Estimate method, a board of experts (4 radiation oncologists, 2 pneumologists, 1 radiologist, 1 medical oncologist) identified key items. Each expert drafted statements for these items, and an extended panel of 24 experts (12 radiation oncologists, 6 pneumologists, 3 radiologists, 3 medical oncologists) rated the statements on a 9-point scale. Consensus was defined as a median score ≥ 7.\n\nRESULTS: Sixteen statements from 10 items reached consensus. The consensus points reached concern the clinical, radiological and functional assesment of patients with ILD, the role of the multidisciplinary team, the accurate evaluation of toxicity predictors, the prevention of complications and the risk/benefit ratio in different clinical scenarios in which radiotherapy is administered alone or in combination with antineoplastic drugs. Conclusion This multidisciplinary consensus on thoracic RT for lung cancer patients with ILD provides valuable guidance for clinicians managing this complex scenario."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) saves lives by detecting early-stage curable cancer and estimates of overdiagnosis in the previous randomised studies were generally low. Screening selection criteria vary, with some programmes only recommending screening for people who are surgical candidates, whereas others make no reference to fitness for surgery. Here we report clinical characteristics and outcomes for participants in the Yorkshire Lung Screening Trial with screen-detected clinical stage I lung cancer according to treatment modality.\n\nMETHODS: Consecutive participants with screen-detected clinical stage I lung cancer were stratified according to curative treatment modality into surgical and SABR cohorts. Factors associated with overall survival and cancer-specific survival were assessed with a median follow-up of 3.6 years.\n\nRESULTS: Of 190 patients with stage I lung cancer studied, 31 % (n = 58) received SABR and 69 % (n = 132) surgery (55 lobectomy, 77 sub-lobar resection). Patients treated with SABR were older with worse performance status and fitness parameters. Cancer-specific survival was similar between the SABR and surgery cohorts (HR for death 1.19, 95 % CI 0.45-3.14, p = 0.72) but overall survival was worse following SABR compared to surgery (HR for death 2.61 95 % CI 1.45-4.69, p = 0.001), indicating that the worse overall survival was due to non-cancer deaths. In the SABR cohort 17 patients (29.3 %) died from non-cancer causes during the study follow-up period compared with 9 (6.8 %) in the surgery cohort. Three-year survival was 69.4 % in the SABR cohort and 92.4 % in the surgical cohort (p < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Cancer-specific survival was similar between the two groups, but overall survival following SABR for screen-detected stage I lung cancer is worse than surgery due to higher rates of non-cancer death within 5 years of treatment. Lung cancer sojourn time has been estimated at around 5 years, so it is likely that rates of overdiagnosis are higher in patients treated with SABR compared to surgery. Further research may be needed to optimise inclusion and exclusion criteria for lung cancer screening."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common histological subtype of lung cancer with high metastatic propensity. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role in tumor metastasis, but the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. This study investigates the role of RIPK2 in EMT and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nMETHODS: TCGA database analysis determined RIPK2 expression and clinical significance. RNA interference, overexpression, qRT-PCR, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence were employed in A549 and PC-9 cell lines. Transwell, EdU, colony formation assays, and cytoskeletal staining assessed cell invasion, proliferation, and EMT changes. Nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) fusion proteins investigated subcellular localization effects. Tail vein injection in nude mice validated in vivo effects.\n\nRESULTS: RIPK2 was highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and associated with poor prognosis. RIPK2 knockdown inhibited while overexpression promoted EMT, invasion, and metastasis. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confirmed direct RIPK2-STAT3 interaction. RIPK2 specifically upregulated EMT transcription factor SNAIL expression. Co-expression of RIPK2 and SNAIL correlated with shorter patient survival. STAT3 or SNAIL knockdown inhibited RIPK2-induced EMT and metastasis. Nuclear-localized RIPK2 completely restored cellular EMT, invasion, and metastatic capabilities while enhancing cisplatin resistance.\n\nCONCLUSION: RIPK2 translocates to the nucleus, interacts with STAT3, and synergistically upregulates SNAIL expression, promoting EMT, invasion, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. The RIPK2-STAT3-SNAIL signaling axis represents a potential therapeutic target."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recent randomized trials demonstrate that intensified therapy improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)compared to osimertinib monotherapy in advancedEGFRmutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), albeit with increased toxicities. Better understanding of post-progression outcomes, impact of local ablative therapy (LAT), and characteristics of long-term responders to osimertinib monotherapy is invaluable for optimizing treatment strategies.\n\nMETHOD: This retrospective study enrolled patients with advanced EGFR mutation positive NSCLC treated with first-line osimertinib monotherapy at Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong between 2017 and 2023. Clinical and genomic characteristics, post-progression therapies, and survival outcomes were analyzed. Studies endpoint included: (1) pattern of disease progression and impact of LAT on survival, and (2) clinical characteristics of long-term responders.\n\nRESULTS: 282 patients were analyzed, with 64 % female and median age of 64. At disease progression, 37 % and 63 % of patients presented with oligoprogressive disease (OPD) and systemic progressive disease (SPD), respectively. Patients with OPD experienced longer time to treatment failure (TTF) and OS compared to those with SPD (TTF 26.0 versus 14.2 months, HR 0.44, p < 0.001; OS 35.4 versus 24.8 months, HR 0.57, p = 0.01). LAT effectively deferred switching systemic therapy among patients who developed OPD. At 2 years, 35 % remained progression-free. Multivariate analysis found ECOG 0-1 and absence of any brain/bone/liver metastases at diagnosis were significantly associated with lower odds of disease progression at 2 years.\n\nCONCLUSION: EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients treated with first-line osimertinib yielded variable outcomes. A significant portion of patients developed OPD, associated with better outcomes and potentially benefit from LAT. Approximately one-third of cases achieved long-term response, predicted by good performance status and absence of brain/bone/liver metastases at diagnosis. These findings support a more personalized approach to first-line treatment in EGFR-mutant NSCLC."

We aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of HER3-DXd in patients with advanced NSCLC and newly diagnosed brain metastases or brain metastases progressing after local therapy.\n\nMETHODS: TUXEDO-3 is a multicohort, multicentre, open-label, single-arm phase 2 trial. In this cohort (2 of 3), we enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years) with histologically documented squamous or non-squamous NSCLC, radiologically documented metastatic disease, newly diagnosed brain metastases or progressing brain metastases after local treatment, at least one brain lesion, no need for immediate local therapy, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Patients received HER3-DXd 5·6 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks. The threshold to meet the primary endpoint was at least 15% of patients having an intracranial response according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases criteria. Activity and safety analyses were done in the full analysis set, which included all participants who received at least one dose of HER3-DXd. This trial (ClinicalTrials.govNCT05865990 and European Union Clinical Trials Register 2023-503251-10-00) is ongoing but no longer enrolling patients.\n\nFINDINGS: Between Dec 27, 2023, and Sept 6, 2024, 20 patients were recruited; ten (50%) were female and ten (50%) were male. 16 (80%) of 20 patients were White; race was not reported in the remaining four patients. 13 (65%) of the 20 patients had brain metastases progressing after local therapy and seven (35%) had untreated brain metastases; five (25%) had activating driver mutations. Median follow-up was 5·3 months (IQR 2·0-8·5). The primary endpoint was met, with six (30%) of 20 patients having intracranial responses (objective response rate 30·0%, 95% CI 11·9-54·3). The six responders had non-squamous advanced NSCLC (two [33%] with untreated brain metastases and four [67%] with progressing brain metastases), of whom one (17%) had an activating driver mutation (KRAS G12C). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 16 (80%) patients, the most common of which were nausea (seven [35%] patients), and diarrhoea and asthenia (each six [30%] patients). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were neutropenia in three (15%) patients and febrile neutropenia in two (10%). There were no treatment-related deaths, and no new safety signals were identified.\n\nINTERPRETATION: HER3-DXd showed promising clinical activity in patients with advanced NSCLC and active brain metastases, and could represent a novel treatment option in this setting.\n\nFUNDING: Daiichi-Sankyo and Merck Sharp & Dohme."

Patients aged 18-75 years with previously untreated, pathologically confirmed, unresectable stage IIIB, IIIC, or stage IV squamous NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1 were eligible for inclusion. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ivonescimab (20 mg/kg) or tislelizumab (200 mg), plus intravenous paclitaxel (175 mg/m\n\nFINDINGS: From Aug 17, 2023, to Jan 21, 2025, 761 patients were screened for eligibility, among whom 532 (70%) patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive ivonescimab plus chemotherapy (266 [50%] patients) or tislelizumab plus chemotherapy (266 [50%] patients). As of Feb 28, 2025, median follow-up time was 10·3 months (95% CI 9·5-11·0).

The progression-free survival benefit with ivonescimab plus chemotherapy was consistent regardless of PD-L1 status. 170 (64%) patients in the ivonescimab group and 144 (54%) patients in the tislelizumab group had grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events, with grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events occurring in 24 (9%) patients in the ivonescimab group and in 27 (10%) patients in the tislelizumab group. Grade 3 or higher treatment-related haemorrhage occurred in five (2%) patients in the ivonescimab group and in two (1%) patients in the tislelizumab group.\n\nINTERPRETATION: In patients with untreated advanced squamous NSCLC, ivonescimab plus chemotherapy showed significantly improved progression-free survival compared with tislelizumab plus chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 status, as well as a manageable safety profile.

We aimed to evaluate whether dual checkpoint blockade with CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors provides similar efficacy to PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy, or whether these strategies produce distinct outcomes across NSCLC subpopulations.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised phase 3 trials published from database inception to Nov 21, 2024, that investigated PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors, with or without CTLA-4 inhibitors, in patients with advanced NSCLC. We focused on studies reporting Kaplan-Meier survival data at 5 years or biomarker analyses based on PD-L1, KRAS, and STK11 mutational status. Individual patient data were extracted from Kaplan-Meier curves with WebPlotDigitizer version 5 and reconstructed with the IPDfromKM method. The primary endpoint of the study was 5-year overall survival in the overall population and in subpopulations based on PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS), tumour histology, and mutational status (mutant vs wild-type) of KRAS and STK11. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD420251081707.\n\nFINDINGS: The initial search yielded 1026 results, and six randomised clinical trials met the eligibility criteria and were included. Among the 2881 patients eligible for analysis (838 [29·1%] female and 2043 [70·9%] male), 1282 received dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade and 1599 received single PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade. Patients treated with dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade had similar median overall survival compared with those treated with single PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibition (16·1 months [95% CI 15·0-17·8] vs 16·9 months [15·5-18·3]; HR 0·95 [95% CI 0·87-1·03], p=0·19). Median overall survival was significantly longer with dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade among patients with PD-L1 TPS less than 1% versus those treated with single PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibition (15·5 months [95% CI 13·6-18·5] vs 14·5 months [13·4-15·9]; HR 0·85 [95% CI 0·74-0·98], p=0·021), with 5-year overall survival rates of 16·6% (95% CI 13·4-20·6) versus 9·3% (7·0-12·3), respectively. Median overall survival in patients with tumours harbouring STK11 mutations was also significantly longer with dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade compared with single PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibition (13·9 months [95% CI 9·8-20·8] vs 7·8 months [6·4-12·9]; HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·49-0·91], p=0·012). However, no significant differences in overall survival were found between treatment groups by tumour histology (squamous vs non-squamous NSCLC) or by KRAS mutational status.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Compared with single PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibition, dual immune checkpoint blockade with CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors was associated with improved overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 TPS less than 1% and in those with STK11 mutations, but not in the overall population. Prospective validation of these results in clinical trials is warranted.\n\nFUNDING: NextGenerationUE."

      "abstract": "The treatment landscape of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has evolved considerably with the integration of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) into first-line regimens. However, the majority of patients will ultimately have primary resistance or develop secondary resistance, driven by a complex interplay of intrinsic tumour biology and adaptive changes within the tumour microenvironment (TME), which can be further amplified by host-related factors such as dysbiosis and organ-specific conditions. Despite these heterogeneous origins, most mechanisms of resistance to ICIs lead to an immunosuppressive TME as the final common pathway. Consequently, current strategies designed to overcome resistance aim to restore antitumour immunity via antibody-based therapies (including bispecific antibodies, T cell engagers and antibody-drug conjugates), targeted therapies, adoptive cell therapies, therapeutic vaccines or intratumoural immunotherapies. Although substantial progress has been made in identifying potential biomarkers associated with immune resistance, the clinical relevance of many of these observations remains limited. Biomarker-driven studies using adaptive, hypothesis-generating designs might offer a promising path forward by navigating the complexity of resistance and enabling the timely evaluation of novel therapeutic concepts. In this Review, we summarize the latest advances in addressing resistance to ICIs in patients with advanced-stage NSCLC and provide insights into emerging clinical strategies and future research directions."

      "abstract": "Although the involvement of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) in metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis has been previously described, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, the starting material for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In a companion study by Zhang et al., we demonstrated that PLK1 phosphorylation of PDHA1 at threonine 57 (PDHA1-T57) drives its protein degradation via mitophagy activation. Using a stable-isotope resolved metabolomics (SIRM) approach, we now show that PLK1 phosphorylation of PDHA1-T57 results in metabolic reprogramming from OXPHOS to glycolysis. Notably, cells mimicking PDHA1-T57 phosphorylation rely more on the aspartate-malate shuttle than on glucose-derived pyruvate to sustain the TCA cycle. This metabolic shift was also observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and transgenic mice conditionally expressing the PDHA1-T57D variant, highlighting the role of PLK1 in metabolic reprogramming in vivo. It is well-established that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-mediated phosphorylation of PDH leads to its inactivation and that dichloroacetic acid (DCA), a PDK inhibitor, has been investigated in preclinical and early clinical studies as a potential therapeutic agent for lung cancer. We demonstrated that DCA combined with Onvansertib, a PLK1 inhibitor, synergistically inhibits lung tumor growth by enhancing mitochondrial ROS, inhibiting glycolysis, and inducing apoptosis. This study aims to elucidate how PLK1-associated activity drives the metabolic reprogramming from OXPHOS to glycolysis during cellular transformation, thereby contributing to lung carcinogenesis. Our results provide support for a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of Onvansertib plus DCA in treating lung cancer."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) has been correlated with an increased risk for radiation pneumonitis (RP) following lung SBRT, but the degree to which locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) patients are affected has yet to be quantified. An algorithm to identify patients at high risk for RP may help clinicians mitigate risk.\n\nMETHODS: All LA-NSCLC patients treated with definitive radiotherapy at our institution from 2006 to 2021 were retrospectively assessed. A convolutional neural network was previously developed to identify patients with radiographic ILD using planning computed tomography (CT) images. All screen-positive (AI-ILD + ) patients were reviewed by a thoracic radiologist to identify true radiographic ILD (r-ILD). The association between the algorithm output, clinical and dosimetric variables, and the outcomes of grade ≥3 RP and mortality were assessed using univariate (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.\n\nRESULTS: 698 patients were included in the analysis. Grade (G) 0-5 RP was reported in 51 %, 27 %, 17 %, 4.4 %, 0.14 % and 0.57 % of patients, respectively. Overall, 23 % of patients were classified as AI-ILD+. On MVA, only AI-ILD status (OR 2.15, p = 0.03) and AI-ILD score (OR 35.27, p < 0.01) were significant predictors of G3+RP. Median OS was 3.6 years in AI-ILD- patients and 2.3 years in AI-ILD+patients (NS). Patients with r-ILD had significantly higher rates of severe toxicities, with G3+RP 25 % and G5 RP 7 %. R-ILD was associated with an increased risk for G3+RP on MVA (OR 5.42, p < 0.01).\n\nCONCLUSION: Our AI-ILD algorithm detects patients with significantly increased risk for G3+RP."
