      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite immunotherapy±chemotherapy has transformed the therapeutic landscape for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), critical questions remain regarding how detailed smoking history affects the evolving treatment options and the underlying molecular mechanisms driving these effects.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed 4157 patients with advanced NSCLC who were treated with immunotherapy monotherapy (IO alone) (n=2768) or chemoimmunotherapy (chemo-IO) (n=1389) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (2010-2023). Associations between detailed smoking history (status and cumulative pack-years) and clinical outcomes were assessed using multivariable analyses. First-line chemo-IO versus IO alone was compared in programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) of ≥50%\n\nRESULTS: In patients receiving IO alone, both smoking status and intensity showed dose-dependent associations with improved response and survival outcomes. In contrast, among patients receiving chemo-IO, smoking history did not affect initial response but patients with active (HR=0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94, p=0.01) and heavy tobacco use (HR=0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93, p=0.001) showed improved progression-free survival (PFS), and a trend toward improved overall survival (OS). Importantly, these associations remained independent of\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Detailed smoking history provides crucial insights for optimizing IO selection in advanced NSCLC through mechanistic alterations in both the tumor microenvironment and systemic plasma protein profiles."

      "abstract": "Multiplexed imaging of tissues is an approach that holds promise for improving early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. Here, we investigated multiplexed histological images of paired pre- and on-treatment samples from nine patients with immunotherapy-refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with an oral HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat) combined with a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab). Patient responses comprised of either stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). An extensive multiplexed-image analysis pipeline involving both cell segmentation and quadrats, coupled with spatial statistics, machine learning, and deep learning was built to analyze the spatial and temporal features that predict disease progression and identify potential clinical biomarkers. Distinct spatial immune ecologies existed between SD and PD patients, and tumors from PD patients were already characterized by an immune-suppressive environment prior to treatment. Finally, the learned spatial ecologies predicted disease progression better than PD-L1 status alone, suggesting these ecologies could be used as potential companion biomarkers with PD-L1 in NSCLC. These findings will be investigated in a larger-cohort study generated from an ongoing clinical trial (NCT02638090) that includes a wider range of responses including complete and partial responders. Together, this study developed a computational infrastructure for analyzing multiplex imaging to predict immunotherapy response in NSCLC, which can potentially be generalized to any type of cancer."

      "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive thoracic disease characterized by rapid proliferation and early metastatic spread. The survival outcomes for SCLC patients remain notoriously poor, underlining that only modest improvements have been achieved in clinical settings to date. However, insights gained from human tumors and preclinical models in recent years have shed light on the heterogeneous molecular profile of SCLC. Numerous research groups have, therefore, begun to stratify SCLC into subgroups based on differential transcription factor expression, the tumor immune microenvironment, and other criteria. Since SCLC subtypes show major differences in their molecular landscape and biological behavior, they may offer unique therapeutic vulnerabilities and serve as a framework for future personalized clinical trials. Here, we summarize impactful classification attempts from the last ten years, highlighting discrepancies and connections between the nomenclature of each study, and expound upon relevant factors of SCLC biology influencing subtype composition and plasticity. This review delves into the implications of subgrouping for understanding and treating SCLC as well as potential future directions for SCLC research."

      "abstract": "Unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibits substantial heterogeneity and complexity. The landmark LAURA and POLESTAR studies have established a standard therapeutic model involving targeted consolidation therapy with osimertinib or aumolertinib after definitive chemoradiotherapy for NSCLC patients harboring EGFR-sensitive mutations. However, treatment strategies for patients with other driver gene mutations (e.g., ALK fusions, ROS1 rearrangement) still lack robust support from high-level evidence-based medical study. To enhance the standardization of diagnosis and treatment for unresectable stage III driver-positive NSCLC patients, the Radiotherapy Committee of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology convened an expert working group. This group identified common clinical practice issues and conducted an in-depth, problem-oriented analysis of domestic and international guidelines alongside evidence-based medical data. Through multiple rounds of comprehensive discussion and expert voting, this consensus was jointly developed. It provides evidence-based recommendations addressing frequently encountered clinical questions regarding unresectable stage III driver-positive NSCLC, aiming to serve as a key reference for clinical practice."

A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from inception to February 7, 2025, to identify relevant clinical trials. Data on malignancies and MACE incidence were extracted, and pooled risk ratios (RR) were calculated using a random-effects model. A total of 18 studies (N = 111,260) met the inclusion criteria. JAK inhibitors were associated with a significantly increased risk of malignancies excluding NMSC (RR = 1.30, 95%CI: 1.05, 1.60; P = 0.016), NMSC (RR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.23, 1.93; P < 0.01), overall malignancies (RR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.18, 2.00; P = 0.002), lung cancer (RR = 1.52, 95%CI: 1.11, 2.08; P = 0.009), lymphoma (RR = 3.69, 95%CI: 1.19, 11.42; P = 0.024), non-small cell lung cancer (RR = 1.70, 95%CI: 1.01, 2.86; P = 0.047), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (RR = 2.30, 95%CI: 1.44, 3.65; P < 0.01), and thyroid cancer (RR = 7.51, 95%CI: 1.39, 40.74; P = 0.019). In contrast, JAK inhibitors did not significantly alter the risk of MACE (RR = 0.75, 95%CI: 0.38, 1.45; P = 0.390), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (RR = 1.52, 95%CI: 0.90, 2.56; P = 0.117), or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR = 1.77, 95%CI: 0.84, 3.34; P = 0.079). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) confirmed data adequacy, and meta-regression indicated that sample size, treatment duration, and patient age did not influence outcomes. JAK inhibitors are associated with an elevated risk of malignancies but do not significantly affect MACE, VTE, or DVT risk in RA patients. Further large-scale post-marketing surveillance is warranted to refine the safety profile of JAK inhibitors in RA management."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer remains a significant medical problem in Asia, and improved treatments are needed for patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who are frail with poor performance status or substantial comorbidities. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of first-line atezolizumab vs. single-agent chemotherapy in the Asian subpopulation in IPSOS trail.\n\nMETHODS: This exploratory analysis of the Asian subpopulation from the phase 3, global, open-label, randomized controlled IPSOS trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab (1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) vs. single-agent chemotherapy (investigator's choice of vinorelbine or gemcitabine) as first-line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, who were ineligible for platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS); other outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and safety.\n\nRESULTS: Seventy patients from China and Vietnam were included. Median OS was 15.8 months in the atezolizumab group vs. 12.5 months in the chemotherapy group; unstratified hazard ratio, 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.41, 1.35). Median PFS was 8.1 months vs. 5.4 months, ORR was 27.9% vs. 7.4%, and median DOR was 18.7 months vs. 9.3 months, in the atezolizumab group vs. in the chemotherapy group, respectively. All-grade and grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were less frequent with atezolizumab compared with chemotherapy. Two patients in the atezolizumab group had grade 5 AEs, namely pneumonia and acute left ventricular failure, with the latter considered treatment-related.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Atezolizumab showed encouraging efficacy results and was well tolerated in an Asian subpopulation of patients with NSCLC who were deemed ineligible for standard platinum-based chemotherapy. The findings of this exploratory subpopulation analysis were consistent with those for the global IPSOS population.\n\nREGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03191786."

Demographic and clinical data were collected at the baseline and follow-up screening rounds, while the vital status and date of death were obtained through a dedicated national platform. Of the 396 diagnosed LCs, 28 (7.1%) were SCLCs; median survival time from the diagnosis was 1.5 years, and overall mortality was 71.4%. Screen-detected SCLCs were 20/28 (71.4%); 5/20 (25%) were prevalent cancers and 15/20 (75%) incident ones. Five-year mortality among the screen-detected and non-screen detected SCLCs was 70% and 62.5%, respectively.The frequency of SCLC was lower as compared to other trials. Although no significant differences in five-year mortality were observed between screen-detected and non-screen-detected SCLCs, the overall five-year mortality was substantially lower than that reported in non-LCS populations, suggesting that LDCT-based LCS has an impact on SCLC outcome, albeit limited."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common histological subtype of lung cancer with high metastatic propensity. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role in tumor metastasis, but the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. This study investigates the role of RIPK2 in EMT and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nMETHODS: TCGA database analysis determined RIPK2 expression and clinical significance. RNA interference, overexpression, qRT-PCR, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence were employed in A549 and PC-9 cell lines. Transwell, EdU, colony formation assays, and cytoskeletal staining assessed cell invasion, proliferation, and EMT changes. Nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) fusion proteins investigated subcellular localization effects. Tail vein injection in nude mice validated in vivo effects.\n\nRESULTS: RIPK2 was highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and associated with poor prognosis. RIPK2 knockdown inhibited while overexpression promoted EMT, invasion, and metastasis. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confirmed direct RIPK2-STAT3 interaction. RIPK2 specifically upregulated EMT transcription factor SNAIL expression. Co-expression of RIPK2 and SNAIL correlated with shorter patient survival. STAT3 or SNAIL knockdown inhibited RIPK2-induced EMT and metastasis. Nuclear-localized RIPK2 completely restored cellular EMT, invasion, and metastatic capabilities while enhancing cisplatin resistance.\n\nCONCLUSION: RIPK2 translocates to the nucleus, interacts with STAT3, and synergistically upregulates SNAIL expression, promoting EMT, invasion, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. The RIPK2-STAT3-SNAIL signaling axis represents a potential therapeutic target."

      "abstract": "Resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remains a major obstacle in the clinical management of EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the transformative therapeutic activity of the multiple iterations of EGFR TKIs, spanning from first-generation reversible inhibitors such as erlotinib and gefitinib to the current standard-of-care third-generation covalent inhibitor osimertinib, primary or acquired resistance to these agents inevitably emerges via diverse mechanisms. The advent of combination therapies that incorporate chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, bispecific antibodies or antibody-drug conjugates has increased clinical benefit but introduced new resistance phenotypes, underscoring the dynamic plasticity and complexity of tumour evolution under therapeutic pressure. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the molecular mechanisms that underlie resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs, describe biomarker-guided and biomarker-unselected therapeutic strategies to overcome these mechanisms, and discuss emerging approaches to pre-empt resistance through early application of combination therapies. We highlight the paradigm shift from radiological to molecular monitoring of resistance to therapy and explore how advances in circulating tumour DNA analysis, artificial intelligence and multi-omics might facilitate adaptive treatment strategies. As the therapeutic landscape evolves, a more complete mechanistic understanding of resistance will be essential to guide rational treatment sequencing, inform trial design and improve long-term outcomes for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC."

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause for cancer related death worldwide. One treatment option for patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma is the targeted therapy gefitinib (Iressa®, ZD1839). As with other promising targeted therapies, desired in vivo effects of gefitinib came short to in vitro expectations, as preclinical testing is hampered by an inaccuracy of existing models and resistances develop frequently. We analysed the pharmacodynamics of gefitinib in a 3D tissue engineered human lung cancer model of HCC827 cells, as well as a resistant subpopulation of HCCres A2 cells. In 2D cell culture, a cell viability of 50 % was reached after treatment with 0.01-0.05 μM gefitinib. In the 3D model administering higher doses of gefitinib did not lead to a further reduction in viability and proliferation, or an increase in apoptosis. This shows that the pharmacodynamic effect of promising new therapies can often be overestimated in 2D versus 3D models. The results we obtained for gefitinib testing in the 3D models reflect astonishing well the efficacy of priorly published clinical data, suggesting that our 3D tumor models can display in vivo conditions more accurately, bridging the gap to living organisms. To mimic the clinical setting further, the lung cancer cells were cultivated under dynamic conditions in a bioreactor. The exploration of a resistant subpopulation confirmed an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The described 3D lung cancer model can be used as a refined, preclinical testing platform for targeted therapies and with clinically relevant pharmacodynamic properties as shown exemplary for gefitinib."

      "abstract": "Despite advances in immunotherapy, unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a highly challenging disease, with only around one-third of patients remaining disease-free at 5 years. The PACIFIC trial established consolidation with the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy as the standard-of-care approach. Furthermore, the LAURA trial has redefined the treatment of patients with stage III unresectable EGFR-mutant NSCLC, demonstrating unprecedented progression-free survival durations with osimertinib consolidation. Despite these advances, novel approaches are urgently needed. Circulating tumour DNA-based monitoring of minimal residual disease is emerging as a personalized method of tailoring treatment duration and escalation strategies. Novel radiotherapy techniques have the potential to provide synergy with immunotherapy while minimizing toxicities. Additionally, ongoing trials evaluating chemoimmunotherapy combinations adapted from the neoadjuvant setting with the potential for conversion to resectable disease might, in the near future, redefine the boundary of surgical resectability. In this Review, we describe the rapidly evolving field of unresectable stage III NSCLC, providing a state-of-the-art overview that includes challenging topics such as biomarkers, personalization of therapy and the role of immunotherapy rechallenge."

      "abstract": "The objective of this research is to investigate the association between occupational radon exposure and pulmonary health outcomes in male miners from Chongqing, China. Between June 2022 and December 2023, 110 miners were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Personal radon exposure levels were measured using passive cumulative dosimeters, with pulmonary health assessed through radiologist-interpreted low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans and serum biomarker analysis (CEA, CYFRA21-1, NSE, and CA125) via ELISA. Multivariable analyses revealed strong dose-response relationships between radon exposure and both serum biomarkers and CT abnormalities. high radon exposure predicted substantial biomarker elevations including a 2.45-fold increase in CYFRA21-1 (β = 0.39, 95 % CI 0.25-0.54, p < 0.001), 1.60-fold increase in CEA (β = 0.20, 0.05-0.35, p = 0.008), and 3.58-fold increased CT abnormality risk (OR = 3.58, p = 0.023). Mediation analysis identified CYFRA21-1 as accounting for 69 % (p = 0.024) and CEA for 24.7 % (p = 0.036) of radon's effect on CT abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that occupational radon exposure contributes to pulmonary damage through both direct effects and biomarker-mediated pathways, with CYFRA21-1 and CEA emerging as potential early indicators of lung cancer in radon-exposed populations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leptomeningeal metastatic disease (LMD) represents a devastating complication of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a poor prognosis. Our understanding of LMD is limited in the era of molecular testing and emerging therapeutic options for lung cancer.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted an international, multicenter, retrospective study involving eight institutions across Asia, United States, and Europe. Patients diagnosed with LMD from advanced NSCLC were identified (2007-2024). Clinicopathological characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes were analyzed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from the LMD diagnosis (LMOS).\n\nRESULTS: A total of 2052 patients with NSCLC and LMD were included and analyzed by molecular subtypes: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (n = 1610), ALK (n = 141), other actionable genomic alterations (other AGA; n = 137), and non-AGA (n = 164). The cumulative prevalence of LMD by molecular subgroups was EGFR, 11.1%; ALK, 11.2%; ROS1, 16%; ERBB2, 12.3%, non-AGA, 3.6%. A higher proportion of LMD was diagnosed >3 years after initial metastatic diagnosis. By the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO)-European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) diagnostic criteria, type I (cerebrospinal fluid cytology positive) had significantly shorter LMOS than type II (magnetic resonance imaging and/or symptom positive). Median LMOS was 10.9 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.0-11.8 months] in all patients. Compared with historical cohorts, patients demonstrated improved LMOS in contemporary cohorts (7.3 versus 11.5 months, P < 0.0001), across all molecular subtypes. In AGA NSCLC, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were associated with improved LMOS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.39, 95% CI 0.31-0.48, P < 0.0001]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) conferred survival benefit in non-AGA patients (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25-0.84, P = 0.012). For the EGFR-mutated cohort, central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant TKI usage delayed LMD onset (P < 0.0001). Continued CNS-penetrant TKIs after LMD diagnosis were associated with longer LMOS (12.4 versus 6.0 months, P < 0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of LMD is rising, largely due to prolonged survival in advanced NSCLC. Contemporary systemic treatments, including TKIs and ICIs, were the main contributors to delayed LMD onset and improved LMD survival."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: While treatment strategies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continue to evolve, the prognostic implications of lymph node metastasis patterns in upper lobe tumors remain inadequately defined. This study investigated whether tumour laterality and specific nodal stations involved in N2a disease correlate with long-term survival in patients undergoing surgical resection for upper lobe NSCLC.\n\nMETHODS: This retrospective single-center study included patients with stage I-IIIB upper lobe NSCLC who underwent anatomical resection with systematic lymph node dissection from January 2010 to December 2022. Patients were stratified by tumour laterality and nodal involvement, with specific analysis of N2a subgroups based on lymph node station. Propensity score matching, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and log-rank testing were used to compare survival outcomes.\n\nRESULTS: Of 3,313 patients considered, 2,028 met the prespecified inclusion criteria (right: n = 1,212; left: n = 816). Mean age was 65.7 ± 9.4 years; 61.7% were male. Median overall survival (OS) was similar for right- and left-sided N0 and N1 tumors. Significant differences emerged among N2a subgroups: Patients with left-sided skip metastases to LN5/6 had markedly improved OS (66.2 ± 14.9 months) versus right-sided LN2/4 (35.3 ± 8.5 months; p = 0.047). Outcomes of left-sided N2a1 LN5/6 were also more favorable than LN7-9 (37.7 ± 15.2 months; p = 0.023) and showed better OS than left-sided N1 disease (47.6 ± 4.2 months; p = 0.284).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Positive nodal station and tumour laterality significantly impact survival in upper lobe NSCLC. Skip metastases to LN5/6 in left-sided tumors were linked to more favorable prognosis and may warrant inclusion in future TNM classification refinements."

Clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics, including co-mutations, smoking history, PD-L1 expression, CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and treatment outcomes, were assessed.\n\nRESULTS: The majority of patients (94.2%) were current or former smokers, with a median tobacco exposure of 40 pack-years. Co-mutations were frequent, most commonly in TP53 (40.2%), STK11 (30.2%), and KEAP1 (29.3%). Heavy smokers exhibited significantly higher PD-L1 expression and more frequent TP53, KEAP1, and NTRK1-3mutations than light smokers. CD8+ T-cell infiltration showed a non-significant trend toward higher values in G12V compared to non-G12V KRAS subtypes. Among 151 patients with advanced disease, those treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) alone or in combination with chemotherapy had significantly higher response rates and improved real-world progression-free (rwPFS) and overall survival (rwOS) compared to chemotherapy alone. In patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, ICB-based treatment achieved a median rwOS of 30 months.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: KRAS G12V-mutated NSCLC is characterized by a strong association with tobacco use, high co-mutation rates in clinically relevant genes, and a favorable response to PD-L1-based immunotherapy. The observed mutation landscape supports the potential for dual checkpoint blockade in a significant subset."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The optimal integration of immunotherapy with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains an area of active investigation. While consolidation immunotherapy is standard, the efficacy and safety of a neoadjuvant approach are not yet established by phase III trials. This real-world study compares outcomes between neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy followed by CRT (NEO) and CRT followed by adjuvant immunotherapy (ADJ, the PACIFIC regimen).\n\nMETHODS: In this multicenter retrospective analysis, we reviewed data from patients with stage III NSCLC who received radical thoracic radiotherapy and peri-radiotherapy immunotherapy between January 2020 and December 2023. Patients were classified into NEO (n = 321) or ADJ (n = 142) groups. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included treatment patterns, recurrence modes, and incidence of pneumonitis. Propensity score matching (PSM) and robust statistical analyses were used to minimize confounding.\n\nRESULTS: The median PFS was significantly longer in the NEO group than in the ADJ group (25.0 months vs. 16.3 months; HR = 0.57, 95 % CI: 0.43-0.74; p < 0.001). Median OS was not reached (NR) in the NEO group compared to 41.1 months in the ADJ group (HR = 0.54, 95 % CI: 0.37-0.78; p = 0.001). The survival benefit for the NEO group remained consistent after PSM and multivariable adjustment. The objective response rate to neoadjuvant therapy was 68.4 %. Patterns of recurrence were similar between groups, with distant metastasis being the most common site of first progression. The incidence of grade ≥2 radiation pneumonitis was comparable (31.8 % NEO vs. 30.8 % ADJ, p = 0.925), though a non-significant trend towards higher grade ≥3 radiation pneumonitis was observed in the NEO group (14.0 % vs. 7.5 %, p = 0.071). Rates of checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis were low and similar between groups.\n\nCONCLUSION: In this large real-world cohort, a treatment sequence incorporating neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy prior to definitive CRT was associated with significantly improved PFS and OS compared to the standard adjuvant immunotherapy approach, without a definitive increase in severe pneumonitis. These findings support the further investigation of neoadjuvant immunotherapy strategies in phase III randomized trials for stage III NSCLC."
