      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The standard treatment for unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is anti-PD-L1 therapy combined with chemoradiotherapy (anti-PD-L1-CRT). Although some patients achieve complete cancer eradication and cure, more than half of patients retain persistent cancer cells. Our research aimed to unravel the nuanced mechanisms involved in both immune attack and evasion induced by anti-PD-L1-CRT with single cell spatial transcriptome.\n\nMETHODS: Xenium is a cutting-edge single-cell spatial analysis tool that enables pathology-based and single-cell analyses while preserving spatial information. In our study, we used Xenium to identify the tumour microenvironment (TME), immune dynamics, and residual cancer cells at the single-cell level following treatment with anti-PD-L1-CRT.\n\nRESULTS: Posttreatment alterations included a significant increase in CXCL9+ cells and CXCL13 + T cells, particularly around tumour cells. Additionally, we discovered that CXCL13 + T cells directly impact cancer cells in the posttreatment environment. Moreover, we identified clusters of immune-cold cancer cells posttreatment, revealing their activation of DNA repair pathways and high proliferative capacity. The novel spatial analysis tool Xenium enabled identification of the immune environment at the single-cell level following treatment with anti-PD-L1-CRT, elucidating its characteristics.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest potential advancements in developing new treatments to improve posttreatment immune responses and address resistance challenges."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 85 % of lung cancers, with five-year survival only 4.5 % for metastatic disease. Programmed death (ligand)-1 (PD-[L]1) inhibitors have advanced NSCLC treatment, but patient demographics can potentially affect clinical outcomes. This systematic literature review and meta-analysis were undertaken to determine if the benefits of anti-PD-(L)1 therapies in NSCLC are independent of race (bio-geographic background).\n\nMETHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and World Health Organization Global Index Medicus were systematically searched (inception-to-Aug-2024). Primary analysis focused on studies with subgroup analysis (White vs Asian, White vs Non-White, Asian vs Non-Asian) of anti-PD-(L)1 efficacy in both resectable/localized and unresectable/advanced NSCLC. Subgroup analysis included stratification by PD-L1 expression, treatment line, and treatment regimen. Bayesian inferential meta-analysis was performed for outcomes with ≥ 1 study.\n\nRESULTS: From 4406 records, 22 randomized controlled trials, 3 pooled analyses, and 2 pharmacokinetic studies were included. In unresectable/advanced NSCLC, anti-PD-(L)1 therapy significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) for White (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80; 95 % credible interval [95 % CrI] 0.74-0.87, p < 0.001 and HR 0.68; 95 % CrI 0.61-0.77, p < 0.001, respectively) and Asian (HR 0.81; 95 % CrI 0.69-0.96, p = 0.027 and HR 0.63; 95 % CrI 0.50-0.80, p = 0.002) patients. The significant improvements in PFS were maintained for both groups within all sub-analyses. Limited data prohibited conduction of meta-analysis for resectable/localized NSCLC.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The benefits of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy in unresectable/advanced NSCLC appear similar for White and Asian patients. Increased quality and quantity of data is required to draw definitive conclusions for resectable/localized NSCLC and with respect to treatment line/regimen and PD-L1 expression."

In particular, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) have distinctive presentations and disease courses. Patients with ALK NSCLC are typically younger, have significantly less smoking exposure, and often experience prolonged survival. When patients recur, drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells may be implicated in disease recurrence. In this review we will discuss the phenomenon of DTP related to ALK NSCLC, possible mechanistic explanations and potential treatment strategies to eliminate DTPs."

We report an exploratory analysis in patients enrolled in Japan. Patients received durvalumab 1500 mg (N = 264), durvalumab+tremelimumab 75 mg (4 doses, N = 200; arm remained blinded), or placebo (N = 266) every 4 weeks for ≤ 24 months. Prior cCRT ± prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was per local standards of care. In the Japan subgroup, 19 and 31 patients received durvalumab and placebo, respectively; prior cCRT comprised cisplatin-etoposide/carboplatin-etoposide in 94.7/5.3% and 87.1/12.9% and once-daily/twice-daily radiotherapy in 10.5/89.5% and 0/100%; 52.6% and 58.1% received PCI. Median OS was not reached versus 44.9 months (3-year OS 67.4% versus 58.1%; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.24-1.62). Median PFS by BICR was 44.2 versus 29.4 months (24-month PFS 59.6% vs. 58.6%; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.44-2.36); median PFS by investigator assessment (sensitivity analysis) was 44.2 versus 19.7 months (24-month PFS 65.6% vs. 47.0%; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.28-1.51). With durvalumab and placebo, 21.1% and 19.4% had maximum grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs), 21.1% and 9.7% had AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and 52.6% and 45.2% had pneumonitis/radiation pneumonitis (grade 3-4: 0% and 6.5%). In conclusion, consolidation durvalumab demonstrated a favorable risk/benefit profile in Japanese patients with LS-SCLC post cCRT. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03703297."

Performance of two software algorithms were independently evaluated by two radiologists: software A (Syngo.via VB30A) by reader 1 and software B (AVIEW v1.1.39.14) by reader 2.

There were disagreements in 17 cases: in 11 (11/300, 3.7 %), this was due to differences in nodule selection and nodule type classification between readers; and in 6 (6/300, 2.0 %), this was due to variations in nodule volume metrics between algorithms. Inter-software agreement was almost perfect (κ = 0.88 [95 %CI: 0.83-0.93]). In the consensus read, reader 1/software A generated 12 misclassifications (11 PM, 1 NM), giving a negative predictive value of 99.6 % (95 % CI: 98.9 %-100.0 %). Reader 2/software B generated 5 misclassifications (2 PM, 3 NM), giving a negative predictive value of 98.9 % (95 % CI: 97.7 %-100.0 %).\n\nCONCLUSION: Two software algorithms (Syngo.via VB30A and AVIEW v1.1.39.14) showed comparable performance for lung nodule volumetric classification at participant/scan level.

Whereas RNA sequencing simply reports skipping of exon 14, DNA sequencing assays indicate the precise DNA nucleotide changes which result in MET exon 14 skipping. Here, we demonstrate the importance of DNA-based sequencing assays for identifying patients with multiple, distinct, METex14 mutant lung cancers.\n\nMETHODS: NSCLC cases with available targeted exome next-generation sequencing (NGS) through OncoPanel or MSK-IMPACT assays were evaluated. Patients with METex14 mutations in ≥2 NSCLC tumor samples at any stage were reviewed to assess tumor relatedness based on clinicopathologic and genomic criteria.\n\nRESULTS: Among 589 patients with METex14 mutant NSCLC and available in-house NGS, 112 had ≥2 NSCLC tumor samples sequenced with METex14 mutations; among these, 7 patients had two distinct METex14 mutant primary lung cancers, and one patient had three primary METex14 mutant lung cancers. Four cases were synchronous primary cancers, occurring within 12 months of the initial diagnosis, while the other four were metachronous, occurring after 12 months. Comprehensive DNA genomic analysis confirmed the distinct clonality of the tumors, with each case showing different METex14 alterations as well as other distinct genomic events, supporting the diagnosis of independent primary lung cancers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: DNA-based sequencing of the MET gene improves staging accuracy to guide appropriate management for patients with multiple primary METex14 mutant NSCLCs."

The primary objective was maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics, and tumor response (RECIST v1.1).\n\nRESULTS: As of February 21, 2024, 168 patients received obrixtamig, 72% received ≥2 lines of previous anticancer therapy, and 51% received previous anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Seven dose-limiting toxicities occurred during MTD evaluation (Regimen A, n = 1; Regimen B2, n = 6). MTD was not reached. The most common treatment-related adverse event was cytokine release syndrome (any grade: 57%; grade ≥3: 3%); most cases occurred early and were reversible. Across all doses, regimens, and tumor types, the overall response rate (ORR) was 23% (95% CI, 17.4% to 30.2%), the median duration of response (DoR) was 8.5 months (95% CI, 6.2 to not reached), and the 6-month DoR rate was 70% (95% CI, 53% to 88%). All patients in Regimens B2/B3 received the minimum effective dose (≥90 μg/kg once weekly or once every 3 weeks), achieving an ORR of 28% (95% CI, 20.7% to 35.9%). With Regimens B2/B3, ORRs were 21% (95% CI, 12.9% to 33.1%), 27% (95% CI, 17.4% to 39.6%), and 70% (95% CI, 39.7% to 89.2%) for SCLC, epNECs, and LCNEC-L, respectively.\n\nCONCLUSION: The demonstrated tolerability and efficacy of obrixtamig regimens, administered as step-up followed by target doses of 90-1,080 μg/kg (once weekly or once every 3 weeks), in patients with heavily pretreated DLL3-positive tumors support further exploration in SCLC, epNEC, and LCNEC-L."
