      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in never-smokers is a major public health burden, especially among East Asian women. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are promising for risk stratification but are primarily developed in European-ancestry populations. We aimed to develop and validate single- and multi-ancestry PRSs for East Asian never-smokers to improve LUAD risk prediction.\n\nMETHODS: PRSs were developed using genome-wide association study summary statistics from East Asian (8,002 cases; 20,782 controls) and European (2,058 cases; 5,575 controls) populations. Single-ancestry models included PRS-25, PRS-CT, and LDpred2; multi-ancestry models included LDpred2+PRS-EUR128, PRS-CSx, and CT-SLEB. Performance was evaluated in independent East Asian data from the Female Lung Cancer Consortium (FLCCA) and externally validated in the Nanjing Lung Cancer Cohort (NJLCC). We assessed predictive accuracy via AUC, with 10-year and (age 30-80) absolute risks estimates.\n\nRESULTS: The best multi-ancestry PRS, using East Asian and European data via CT-SLEB (clumping and thresholding, super learning, empirical Bayes), outperformed the best East Asian-only PRS (LDpred2; AUC = 0.629, 95% CI:0.618,0.641), achieving an AUC of 0.640 (95% CI : 0.629,0.653) and odds ratio of 1.71 (95% CI : 1.61,1.82) per SD increase. NJLCC Validation confirmed robust performance (AUC =0.649, 95% CI: 0.623, 0.676). The top 20% PRS group had a 3.92-fold higher LUAD risk than the bottom 20%. Further, the top 5% PRS group reached a 6.69% lifetime absolute risk. Notably, this group reached the average population 10-year LUAD risk at age 50 (0.42%) by age 41, nine years earlier.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Multi-ancestry PRS approaches enhance LUAD risk stratification in East Asian never-smokers, with consistent external validation, suggesting future clinical utility."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With nearly one-third of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score≥50% surviving beyond 5 years following first-line pembrolizumab, long-term outcomes challenge traditional paradigms of cancer prognostication. The emergence of non-cancer-related factors and time-dependent trends underscores the need for advanced analytical frameworks to unravel their complex interplay.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed the Pembro-real 5Y registry, a global real-world dataset of 1050 patients treated across 61 institutions in 14 countries with a long-term follow-up and a large panel of baseline variables. Two complementary approaches were employed: ridge regression, chosen for its ability to address multicollinearity while retaining interpretability, and not another imputation method (NAIM), a transformer-based artificial intelligence model designed to handle missing data without imputation. Endpoints included risk of death at 6, 12, 24, 60 months and 5-year survival.\n\nRESULTS: The ridge regression model achieved a c-statistic of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.72) for the risk of death and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.78) for 5-year survival, identifying Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS)≥2, increasing age, and metastatic burden as primary risk factors. However, wide CIs for some predictors highlighted statistical instability. NAIM demonstrated robust handling of missing data, with a c-index of 62.98±2.11 for risk of death and an AUC of 60.52±3.71 for 5-year survival. The comprehensive SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis revealed dynamic, time-dependent patterns, with early mortality dominated by acute factors (eg, ECOG-PS, steroids) and long-term outcomes increasingly influenced by systemic health markers (eg, absence of hypertension, increasing body mass index). Unexpected insights included the protective role of dyslipidemia (but not statins) and the nuanced impact of smoking status, reflecting evolving disease dynamics and host-tumor interplay.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our integrative framework illuminates the complexity of long-term outcomes in patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab, uncovering dynamic, non-linear prognostication trends. This analysis provides insights into patient trajectories, emphasizing the need for holistic, long-term management strategies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are linked to thrombotic events, but the thrombosis risk in various cancers is unclear. This study evaluates the incidence and risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) in patients with solid tumors treated with PARPi.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This meta-analysis included randomized controlled phase II and III clinical trials in which patients with prostate, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, glioblastoma, small-cell lung (SCLC), and non-small-cell lung (NSCLC) cancers were treated with PARPi as monotherapy or in combination. The primary endpoint was to assess the frequency and risk of VTEs in patients treated with PARPi, while the secondary endpoint compared the incidence across different cancer subtypes.\n\nRESULTS: The analysis included 15 008 patients from 38 studies: 8805 in the PARPi group and 6203 in the control group. There were 11 ovarian cancer (n = 4348), 8 prostate cancer (n = 3872), 9 breast cancer (n = 4448), 4 NSCLC (n = 1063), and 3 SCLC (n = 583) studies, and 1 study each for pancreatic cancer (n = 50), glioblastoma (n = 123), and gastric (n = 521) cancer. The incidence of any-grade VTEs with PARPi was observed to be 2.4%, compared with 1.6% in controls, suggesting a possible increase in risk [odds ratio (OR) 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.88, P = 0.050]. This association appeared to be more pronounced in patients with prostate cancer (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.06-3.70, P = 0.030) and pancreatic cancer (OR 7.22, 95% CI 1.40-37.25, P = 0.020).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: While our findings indicate a possible association between PARPi and VTE risk in certain cancer types, this risk appears to be influenced by factors such as cancer subtype and treatment combinations. The overall contribution of PARPi monotherapy to VTE risk may be limited, and the results should be interpreted with caution due to study heterogeneity, wide CIs, and the absence of patient-level data."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have shown marked efficacy for HER2 mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The intracellular trafficking of mutant HER2 has remained to be fully elucidated, however.\n\nMETHODS: HER2 dynamics were examined in cells expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant HER2 with the use of live cell imaging and an in situ proximity ligation assay. Proteins related to mutant HER2 trafficking were identified by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry.\n\nRESULTS: HER2 internalization was enhanced in NSCLC cells expressing mutant HER2 compared with those expressing HER2(WT). Homodimers of HER2(WT) were localized mainly at the cell surface, whereas those of mutant HER2 were present mostly in the cytoplasm. Knockdown of EGFR or HER3 suppressed internalization of HER2(WT) but not that of mutant HER2. The enhanced internalization of mutant HER2 was mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, as was reflected by increased binding of the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl to mutant HER2 and its consequent ubiquitination, and was attenuated by treatment with zongertinib, a HER2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of HER2 phosphorylation promotes internalization of mutant HER2 mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, likely contributing to the efficacy of HER2-targeted ADCs in NSCLC positive for HER2 mutations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The standard treatment for unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is anti-PD-L1 therapy combined with chemoradiotherapy (anti-PD-L1-CRT). Although some patients achieve complete cancer eradication and cure, more than half of patients retain persistent cancer cells. Our research aimed to unravel the nuanced mechanisms involved in both immune attack and evasion induced by anti-PD-L1-CRT with single cell spatial transcriptome.\n\nMETHODS: Xenium is a cutting-edge single-cell spatial analysis tool that enables pathology-based and single-cell analyses while preserving spatial information. In our study, we used Xenium to identify the tumour microenvironment (TME), immune dynamics, and residual cancer cells at the single-cell level following treatment with anti-PD-L1-CRT.\n\nRESULTS: Posttreatment alterations included a significant increase in CXCL9+ cells and CXCL13 + T cells, particularly around tumour cells. Additionally, we discovered that CXCL13 + T cells directly impact cancer cells in the posttreatment environment. Moreover, we identified clusters of immune-cold cancer cells posttreatment, revealing their activation of DNA repair pathways and high proliferative capacity. The novel spatial analysis tool Xenium enabled identification of the immune environment at the single-cell level following treatment with anti-PD-L1-CRT, elucidating its characteristics.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest potential advancements in developing new treatments to improve posttreatment immune responses and address resistance challenges."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)-negative nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a poor prognosis. There have been no prospective studies targeting TTF-1-negative nonsquamous NSCLC.\n\nMETHODS: This multicenter, single-arm phase 2 study enrolled chemotherapy-naïve individuals with TTF-1-negative advanced nonsquamous NSCLC to receive four cycles of atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel, followed by atezolizumab alone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nRESULTS: Between June 2022 and March 2024, 52 patients (41 male and 11 female) with a median age of 68.0 years were enrolled. Thirty-three patients had adenocarcinoma and 19 had nonadenocarcinoma. Nineteen, 30, and 3 patients were current, former, and never-smokers, respectively. The PD-L1 tumor proportion score was < 1 % in 22 cases, 1-49 % in 18 cases, ≥ 50 % in 11 cases, and unknown in 1 case. The median PFS was 4.9 months (80 % confidence interval [CI], 4.3-5.9 months). The lower limit of the 80 % CI did not exceed the prespecified threshold of 4.5 months; therefore, the study did not meet its primary endpoint. The median overall survival was 13.2 months (95 % CI, 10.3-27.2 months). The response rate was 56.9 % (95 % CI, 43.3-69.5 %). There were no new safety signals.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This first prospective study of individuals with TTF-1-negative advanced nonsquamous NSCLC has provided evidence for the efficacy and safety of the combination of carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel with atezolizumab in such patients. The prognosis of TTF-1-negative advanced nonsquamous NSCLC remains poor, however, warranting further treatment development."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osimertinib is commonly used as a first-line treatment for EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the optimal treatment strategy following osimertinib failure remains unclear.\n\nMETHODS: Patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation after failure of osimertinib treatment were assigned to a regimen of afatinib (20 mg daily) combined with carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m\n\nRESULTS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled. One patient met the exclusion criteria, and the efficacy was evaluated in the remaining 35 patients. The 6M-PFSR, the primary endpoint, was 57.1 %. The confidence interval of 39.3-71.5 % exceeded the predefined threshold of 35 %, thereby meeting its primary endpoint. Notably, 28.6 % of patients achieved a long-term PFS of 1 year or longer. The objective response rate (ORR) was 51.4 %, the disease control rate (DCR) was 88.6 %, the median PFS was 8.2 months, the median duration of response (DOR) was 5.6 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 22.5 months. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (52.8 %) and anorexia (47.2 %), both of which were predictable and manageable. Interstitial pneumonia developed in three patients (8.3 %), one of whom died. Another patient died from sepsis, bringing the total number of deaths in the study to two.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The combination of afatinib and the platinum doublet demonstrated satisfactory efficacy with manageable adverse events in tumors refractory to osimertinib, meeting its primary endpoint.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: jRCTs021200005."

We evaluated the safety and activity of tarlatamab in combination with atezolizumab or durvalumab as first-line maintenance therapy in patients with extensive-stage (ES)-SCLC.\n\nMETHODS: In this multicentre, non-randomised, phase 1b study, patients aged 18 years and older, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 and without disease progression after four to six cycles of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy plus a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor (if available), received tarlatamab 10 mg intravenously once every 2 weeks, after an initial tarlatamab 1 mg dose, with atezolizumab intravenously (1680 mg once every 4 weeks) or durvalumab intravenously (1500 mg once every 4 weeks) as maintenance until disease progression. Patients were enrolled from 30 centres in 13 countries. The primary objective was to evaluate safety and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose or maximum tolerated dose of tarlatamab in combination with a PD-L1 inhibitor through assessment of dose-limiting toxicities, treatment-emergent adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, and changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests. All patients who received at least one dose of tarlatamab were included in the analyses. Because overall survival data were immature at the primary analysis, in this Article, we report a non-specified interim analysis to provide an updated examination of overall survival and longer-term safety. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05361395; the EU Clinical Trials registry, 2021-005462-17; and EudraCT, 2024-511021-58.\n\nFINDINGS: Between Aug 31, 2022, and Jan 30, 2024, 88 patients received tarlatamab with atezolizumab or durvalumab after standard-of-care first-line chemo-immunotherapy. The median time from start of standard-of-care first-line chemo-immunotherapy to start of tarlatamab maintenance was 3·6 months (IQR 3·2-4·3). The median follow-up from the start of maintenance was 18·4 months (15·2-23·0) and the median exposure to tarlatamab was 35 weeks (8-75). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hyponatraemia (nine [10%] of 88 patients), anaemia (seven [8%] of 88 patients), and neutropenia (six [7%] of 88 patients). Serious adverse events occurred in 50 (57%) of 88 patients. The most common serious adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (21 [24%] of 88 patients), pyrexia (six [7%] of 88 patients), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (four [5%] of 88 patients), and pneumonia (four [5%] of 88 patients). There were no deaths due to treatment-related adverse events. Median overall survival was 25·3 months (95% CI 20·3-not estimable).\n\nINTERPRETATION: Tarlatamab plus a PD-L1 inhibitor as maintenance after first-line chemo-immunotherapy showed a manageable safety profile with promising anticancer activity, supporting the ongoing phase 3 trial (NCT06211036).\n\nFUNDING: Amgen."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Survival for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unacceptably low, even in stage IA-IIA. Current guidelines recommend adjuvant treatment for patients considered to be at high risk in stages IB and IIA, but suggest criteria that have not been validated to predict benefit. A previously validated, CLIA-certified 14-gene expression profile has identified patients with high-risk non-squamous NSCLC tumours in stages IA-IIA who benefitted from adjuvant chemotherapy in a non-randomised prospective study. In this prespecified interim analysis, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage IA-IIA molecular high-risk non-squamous NSCLC in a randomised trial.\n\nMETHODS: AIM-HIGH, a randomised, phase 3 trial, was done at 45 centres in France, Germany, and the USA. Patients aged 18 years or older with stage IA-IIA non-squamous NSCLC, an adequate tumour sample, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 underwent risk stratification with the 14-gene assay. Patients with a molecular high risk, defined as those receiving a high-risk or an intermediate-risk score, were randomly assigned (1:1) to four cycles of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy (using local institutional standard of care regimens) or observation. Randomisation was stratified according to age, sex, and tumour size of 4 cm or more. The primary outcomes for the study and for this prespecified interim analysis were 48-month and 24-month disease-free survival, respectively, in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which was defined as randomly assigned patients who continued to meet eligibility criteria either at chemotherapy initiation or at random assignment to observation; an early interim analysis was prespecified to detect a large difference between groups. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01817192, and is closed to enrolment.\n\nFINDINGS: Between Sept 11, 2020, and Feb 7, 2025, 449 patients were enrolled and underwent risk stratification. 236 patients with molecular high risk were randomly assigned to chemotherapy (n=124) or observation (n=112). At the time of the prespecified interim analysis, 87 patients were evaluable in the mITT population (47 [54%] males and 40 [46%] females; median age 63 years [IQR 52-74]) in the chemotherapy group and 107 (58 [54%] males and 49 [46%] females; 66 years [56-76]) in the observation group. 48 (55%) patients in the chemotherapy group and 58 (54%) patients in the observation group had stage IA disease; 34 (39%) and 44 (41%), respectively, had stage IB disease, and five (6%) and five (5%), respectively, had stage IIA disease. Six (3%) of 200 patients in the mITT population had died at the time of the interim analysis. 24-month disease-free survival was 96% (95% CI 92-100) with adjuvant chemotherapy versus 79% (70-90) with observation (hazard ratio 0·22 [0·06-0·76]; p=0·0087).\n\nINTERPRETATION: The 14-gene assay identified patients with molecular high risk who benefitted from adjuvant chemotherapy. Use of the assay to determine eligibility for adjuvant therapy in stage IA-IIA non-squamous NSCLC has the potential to substantially improve otherwise persistently poor outcomes.\n\nFUNDING: Razor Genomics."

Second-generation D3-GPC2 CAR T cells with either a 4-1BB or CD28 co-stimulatory domain were selectively activated and induced potent neuroblastoma cell cytotoxicity in several complementary in vitro co-incubation assays. Conversely, no measurable cytotoxicity or D3-GPC2 CAR T cell activation was observed in co-incubation studies with nine primary human normal tissue cell lines. Moreover, GPC2 CAR T cells induced significant regression of GPC2-expressing neuroblastoma xenografts. No GPC2 CAR-related toxicities were noted, including in comprehensive mouse necropsies performed after GPC2 CAR T cell administration. Finally, to explore the potential broader clinical impact of GPC2 CAR T cells we showed that they are also potently cytotoxic to preclinical models of GPC2-expressing small cell lung cancers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These data validate GPC2 as a bona fide CAR T cell target in neuroblastoma and other cancers. The safety and preliminary efficacy of GPC2 CAR T cells are being tested in a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial for children with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma (NCT05650749)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-L1 or PD-1 as monotherapy or combined with CTLA-4 inhibitors or chemotherapy (or both) are the standard of care for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it remains unclear which patients benefit from the addition of CTLA-4 inhibitors. We aimed to evaluate whether dual checkpoint blockade with CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors provides similar efficacy to PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy, or whether these strategies produce distinct outcomes across NSCLC subpopulations.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised phase 3 trials published from database inception to Nov 21, 2024, that investigated PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors, with or without CTLA-4 inhibitors, in patients with advanced NSCLC. We focused on studies reporting Kaplan-Meier survival data at 5 years or biomarker analyses based on PD-L1, KRAS, and STK11 mutational status. Individual patient data were extracted from Kaplan-Meier curves with WebPlotDigitizer version 5 and reconstructed with the IPDfromKM method. The primary endpoint of the study was 5-year overall survival in the overall population and in subpopulations based on PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS), tumour histology, and mutational status (mutant vs wild-type) of KRAS and STK11. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD420251081707.\n\nFINDINGS: The initial search yielded 1026 results, and six randomised clinical trials met the eligibility criteria and were included. Among the 2881 patients eligible for analysis (838 [29·1%] female and 2043 [70·9%] male), 1282 received dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade and 1599 received single PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade. Patients treated with dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade had similar median overall survival compared with those treated with single PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibition (16·1 months [95% CI 15·0-17·8] vs 16·9 months [15·5-18·3]; HR 0·95 [95% CI 0·87-1·03], p=0·19). Median overall survival was significantly longer with dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade among patients with PD-L1 TPS less than 1% versus those treated with single PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibition (15·5 months [95% CI 13·6-18·5] vs 14·5 months [13·4-15·9]; HR 0·85 [95% CI 0·74-0·98], p=0·021), with 5-year overall survival rates of 16·6% (95% CI 13·4-20·6) versus 9·3% (7·0-12·3), respectively. Median overall survival in patients with tumours harbouring STK11 mutations was also significantly longer with dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade compared with single PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibition (13·9 months [95% CI 9·8-20·8] vs 7·8 months [6·4-12·9]; HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·49-0·91], p=0·012). However, no significant differences in overall survival were found between treatment groups by tumour histology (squamous vs non-squamous NSCLC) or by KRAS mutational status.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Compared with single PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibition, dual immune checkpoint blockade with CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors was associated with improved overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 TPS less than 1% and in those with STK11 mutations, but not in the overall population. Prospective validation of these results in clinical trials is warranted.\n\nFUNDING: NextGenerationUE."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treating patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) with poor performance status poses considerable challenges. We aimed to evaluate the combination of an immune checkpoint inhibitor with platinum-based therapy in this population.\n\nMETHODS: This open-label, single-arm phase 2 NEJ045A trial enrolled untreated patients with extensive-stage SCLC with performance status 2 or 3. Participants received four cycles of durvalumab, carboplatin, and etoposide, followed by durvalumab maintenance. A dose adjustment strategy was used, with initial reductions in carboplatin-etoposide dosages, subsequently adjusted based on adverse events, allowing for potential escalation. The primary endpoint was tolerability, assessed by the proportion of patients completing induction therapy. A key secondary endpoint was 1-year survival rate. This trial is registered at the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs031200319) and has been completed.\n\nFINDINGS: Between April 8, 2021, and Oct 3, 2023, 57 patients (performance status 2 n=43 and performance status 3 n=14) were enrolled with a median age of 73·5 years (IQR 69·0-77·5), 44 (79%) of 56 were male. 26 (67%; 80% CI 55·2-76·7; p<0·0001) of 39 patients with performance status 2 and five (50%; 26·7-73·3; p=0·0088) of ten with performance status 3 completed induction therapy, exceeding the pre-specified threshold. Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 52 (93%) of 56 patients, and 12 (21%) of 56 discontinued due to adverse events. The 1-year survival rates were 43·4% (80% CI 34·1-53·1) overall (p<0·0001), 50·0% (39·1-60·9) in performance status 2 (p<0·0001), and 18·2% (5·0-41·5) in performance status 3.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Durvalumab, carboplatin, and etoposide showed tolerability and promising efficacy as a first-line treatment for patients with untreated extensive-stage SCLC with poor performance status, supporting the integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors in this therapeutically challenging population.\n\nFUNDING: AstraZeneca KK."
