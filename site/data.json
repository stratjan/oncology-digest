      "abstract": "Diverse fusions of EML4 and ALK are oncogenic drivers in lung adenocarcinomas. EML4-ALK variants have distinct breakpoints within EML4, but their functional differences remain poorly understood. Here, we use somatic genome editing to generate autochthonous mouse models of EML4-ALK-driven lung tumors and show that V3 is more oncogenic than V1. By employing multiplexed genome editing and quantifying the effects of 29 putative tumor suppressor genes on V1- and V3-driven lung cancer growth, we show that many tumor suppressor genes have variant-specific effects on tumorigenesis. Pharmacogenomic analyses further suggest that tumor genotype can influence therapeutic responses. Analysis of human EML4-ALK-positive lung cancers also identified variant-specific differences in their genomic landscapes. These findings suggest that EML4-ALK variants behave more like distinct oncogenes rather than a uniform entity and highlight the dramatic impact of oncogenic fusion partner proteins and coincident tumor suppressor gene alterations on the biology of oncogenic fusion-driven cancers."

      "abstract": "SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 are the core catalytic subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Approximately 10% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbor SMARCA4 mutations, resulting in protein loss or loss-of-function (LOF) alterations. These SMARCA4-deficient cancers are highly dependent on SMARCA2 for proliferation, growth, and survival, making SMARCA2 a promising synthetic lethal target. Here, we developed and characterized PRT3789, a clinical-stage SMARCA2-selective targeted protein degrader (TPD). It induced polyubiquitination at lysine residues unique to SMARCA2 through stable ternary complex formation with the VHL E3 ligase. The selectivity was driven by interactions with an extended loop unique to SMARCA2, as revealed by structure-based analyses. PRT3789 promoted selective degradation of SMARCA2, while sparing its highly homologous paralog, SMARCA4. In SMARCA4-deficient models, SMARCA2 degradation disrupted SWI/SNF complex integrity by inducing dissociation of multiple subunits, leading to downstream transcriptional reprogramming. PRT3789 induced robust tumor growth inhibition and regression in SMARCA4-deficient models, both as monotherapy and in combination with targeted therapies or chemotherapies. In contrast, SMARCA4-wild-type models exhibited minimal response despite confirmed SMARCA2 degradation, consistent with SMARCA4 sparing and preserved SWI/SNF complex integrity. In clinical settings, PRT3789 reduced SMARCA2 protein levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with SMARCA4-mutated cancers. Initial signs of clinical activity have been observed, including RECIST-confirmed partial responses. Together, these findings demonstrate the selective targeting of SMARCA2 and the potential for a favorable therapeutic index with PRT3789. Phase I/II clinical trials with PRT3789 are ongoing in biomarker-selected patients with SMARCA4-mutated solid tumors."

      "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a characteristic form of cell death triggered by excessive iron-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) that plays an important role in suppressing tumor development. Here, we identified MEN1 as a driver of ferroptosis in lung cancer. MEN1 facilitated lipid ROS generation and sensitized lung cancer cells to ferroptosis by perturbing CD44 precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing. CD44 variant isoforms were highly expressed and correlated with poor prognosis in human lung cancers. Loss of Men1 profoundly accelerated the progression of mutant Kras driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and promoted the accumulation of CD44 variant isoforms. Mechanistically, MEN1 maintained a relatively slow RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation by controlling the release of PAF1 from the CD44 pre-mRNA, which in turn prevented the inclusion of CD44 variable exons (CD44v). Furthermore, CD44v6-interfering peptides effectively abrogated the growth and metastasis of established MEN1 deficient tumors by activating ferroptosis. Collectively, this study unveils a mechanism of tumor suppression based on MEN1 regulation of CD44 alternative splicing, ROS production, and ferroptosis induction."

      "abstract": "At the first interim analysis of the global, randomized, phase 3, double-blind ADRIATIC trial in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) not progressing after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT), consolidation durvalumab significantly improved overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] 0.73) and progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR; HR 0.76) versus placebo (dual primary endpoints). We report an exploratory analysis in patients enrolled in Japan. Patients received durvalumab 1500 mg (N = 264), durvalumab+tremelimumab 75 mg (4 doses, N = 200; arm remained blinded), or placebo (N = 266) every 4 weeks for ≤ 24 months. Prior cCRT ± prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was per local standards of care. In the Japan subgroup, 19 and 31 patients received durvalumab and placebo, respectively; prior cCRT comprised cisplatin-etoposide/carboplatin-etoposide in 94.7/5.3% and 87.1/12.9% and once-daily/twice-daily radiotherapy in 10.5/89.5% and 0/100%; 52.6% and 58.1% received PCI. Median OS was not reached versus 44.9 months (3-year OS 67.4% versus 58.1%; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.24-1.62). Median PFS by BICR was 44.2 versus 29.4 months (24-month PFS 59.6% vs. 58.6%; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.44-2.36); median PFS by investigator assessment (sensitivity analysis) was 44.2 versus 19.7 months (24-month PFS 65.6% vs. 47.0%; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.28-1.51). With durvalumab and placebo, 21.1% and 19.4% had maximum grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs), 21.1% and 9.7% had AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and 52.6% and 45.2% had pneumonitis/radiation pneumonitis (grade 3-4: 0% and 6.5%). In conclusion, consolidation durvalumab demonstrated a favorable risk/benefit profile in Japanese patients with LS-SCLC post cCRT. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03703297."

In prospective multicenter studies, 15-17 % of patients undergoing surgical resection for LC develop a second malignancy, often in the lung, with risk persisting beyond 5 years. We characterized its incidence and risk factors, including genetic mutations, in a large retrospective cohort.\n\nMETHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 5,274 patients undergoing complete resection for non-small cell lung cancer at the National Cancer Center Hospital Tokyo between 2011 and 2023. Second primary LCs were identified using the Martini and Melamed criteria. We estimated cumulative incidence with the Fine-Gray competing-risk method, treating death as a competing event, and calculated sub-distribution hazard ratios (SHRs).\n\nRESULTS: The median follow-up was 4.4 years (range: 0-12). Overall, 365 (6.9 %) patients developed a second primary LC at a median interval of 4.1 years. Cumulative incidence from surgery was 0.7 % at 1 year, 6.1 % at 5 years, and 15.1 % at 10 years. Multivariate analysis identified heavy smoking history ([SHR]: 1.47, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.30, p = 0.02), first status of multiple primary lung cancer (MPLC), defined as ≥ 2 synchronous tumors at baseline (SHR: 1.88, 95 % CI: 1.25-2.85, p = 0.002), and higher consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) (SHR: 2.40, 95 % CI: 1.67-3.47, p < 0.001) as independent risk factors. Among 1,292 (24.5 %) patients assessed for genetic mutations, 699 (13.2 %) harbored at least one clinically targetable driver mutation; however, mutation status did not affect risk of second primary LC (p = 0.46).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Heavy smoking history, first status of MPLC, and higher CTR increase the risk of second primary LC; mutation status does not. Patients with these features require intensified, long-term surveillance."

Whereas RNA sequencing simply reports skipping of exon 14, DNA sequencing assays indicate the precise DNA nucleotide changes which result in MET exon 14 skipping. Here, we demonstrate the importance of DNA-based sequencing assays for identifying patients with multiple, distinct, METex14 mutant lung cancers.\n\nMETHODS: NSCLC cases with available targeted exome next-generation sequencing (NGS) through OncoPanel or MSK-IMPACT assays were evaluated. Patients with METex14 mutations in ≥2 NSCLC tumor samples at any stage were reviewed to assess tumor relatedness based on clinicopathologic and genomic criteria.\n\nRESULTS: Among 589 patients with METex14 mutant NSCLC and available in-house NGS, 112 had ≥2 NSCLC tumor samples sequenced with METex14 mutations; among these, 7 patients had two distinct METex14 mutant primary lung cancers, and one patient had three primary METex14 mutant lung cancers. Four cases were synchronous primary cancers, occurring within 12 months of the initial diagnosis, while the other four were metachronous, occurring after 12 months. Comprehensive DNA genomic analysis confirmed the distinct clonality of the tumors, with each case showing different METex14 alterations as well as other distinct genomic events, supporting the diagnosis of independent primary lung cancers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: DNA-based sequencing of the MET gene improves staging accuracy to guide appropriate management for patients with multiple primary METex14 mutant NSCLCs."

The primary endpoint was 5-year overall survival; secondary endpoints included lesion progression. The surgical curative time window was defined as tumor diameter ≤2.0 cm and CTR ≤0.25, a safe radiologic profile during which patients could achieve definite cure after resection.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 406 patients were recruited from five centers. The cohort consisted predominantly of females (75.6%) and never smokers (87.2%), with a median age of 53 years. In total, 1,496 lesions were under surveillance, with a median of three GGOs per patient. The median diameter of the dominant lesion was 0.8 cm. At a median follow-up of 35.4 months, the 5-year overall survival was 100%. Progression occurred in 8.1% of patients, while 1.5% developed new lesions. The median increase in tumor diameter was 0.3 cm. Eight patients underwent surgery after enrollment, all pathologic stage IA1; four had invasive adenocarcinoma and four had minimally invasive adenocarcinoma. Patients were categorized into three groups based on estimated lung function loss if complete resection, with tailored strategies accordingly.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Active surveillance within the surgical curative time window appears to be safe and feasible for patients with multifocal GGOs in the short term. It offers an alternative to immediate surgery and rationalized individualized, scenario-based management strategies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have received substantial policy attention globally and in most countries. Our aim was to quantify how much NCD mortality changed from 2010 to 2019 in different countries, especially compared with the preceding decade and with the best-performing country in each region, and the specific NCD causes of death that contributed to change.\n\nMETHODS: We used data on NCD mortality by sex, age group, and underlying cause of death for 185 countries and territories from the 2021 WHO Global Health Estimates. Our primary outcome was the probability of dying from an NCD between birth and age 80 years in the absence of competing causes of death, and was calculated using age-specific death rates from NCDs and lifetable methods. We calculated change in the probability of death as the difference between values in the final and first year of each period (2001-10 and 2010-19). For 51 countries with high-quality mortality data and 12 countries with large populations within their region, we used the Horiuchi method of decomposition to calculate how much specific causes of death and 5-year age groups contributed towards: (1) increases or decreases in NCD mortality from 2010 to 2019; (2) improvements or deteriorations compared with the preceding decade (2001-10); and (3) differences from the country that had the largest reduction in each region.\n\nFINDINGS: From 2010 to 2019, the probability of dying from an NCD between birth and age 80 years decreased in 152 (82%) of 185 countries for females and in 147 (79%) countries for males; it increased in the remaining 33 (18%) countries for females and 38 (21%) countries for males. The countries where NCD mortality declined for females accounted for 72% of the world female population in 2019, and those where NCD mortality declined for males accounted for 73% of the world male population. NCD mortality declined in all high-income western countries, with Denmark experiencing the largest decline for both sexes and the USA experiencing the smallest decline. Among the largest countries in other regions, NCD mortality declined for both sexes in China, Egypt, Nigeria, Russia, and Brazil, and increased for both sexes in India and Papua New Guinea. On average, females in countries in the central Asia, Middle East and north Africa region had the greatest reduction in NCD mortality followed by those in central and eastern Europe. For males, the largest reduction was among countries in central and eastern Europe, followed by those in central Asia, Middle East and north Africa. The smallest declines were those in the Pacific Island nations. Circulatory diseases were the greatest contributors to declines in NCD mortality from 2010 to 2019 in most countries, with some cancers (eg, stomach and colorectal cancers for both sexes, cervical and breast cancers for females, and lung and prostate cancers for males) also contributing towards lower NCD mortality in 2019 than in 2010 in many countries. Neuropsychiatric conditions and pancreatic and liver cancers contributed towards higher NCD mortality from 2010 to 2019 in most countries. In some countries, NCD mortality in working and older (≥65 years) ages changed in the same direction leading to large overall declines or increases; in others, it changed in opposite directions, diminishing the magnitude of the overall change. In 75 (41%) of 185 countries for females and in 73 (39%) countries for males, the change in NCD mortality from 2010 to 2019 was an improvement (ie, larger decline, smaller increase, or reversal of an increase) compared with the change from 2001 to 2010. These countries accounted for 29% and 63% of the world female and male population, respectively, and included both sexes in Russia and Egypt, and males in China, India, and Brazil. Decadal changes saw a deterioration (ie, smaller decline, larger increase, or reversal of a decline) in the remaining 110 (59%) countries for females and 112 (61%) countries for males, including in both sexes in the USA, Nigeria, and Papua New Guinea, and females in China, India, and Brazil. Change from 2010 to 2019 saw deterioration in direction or size compared with the preceding decade for both sexes in most high-income western countries, most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and in east and southeast Asia, and for females in south Asia. There was a decadal improvement in the direction or size of change for many countries in central and eastern Europe (eg, Russia) and central Asia, and in parts of the Middle East and north Africa. Improvements or deteriorations in the direction or size of change in NCD mortality between the two decades resulted from multiple NCD causes of death. Among causes of death, the decline in mortality from circulatory diseases was smaller from 2010 to 2019 than from 2001 to 2010 in most countries, except in countries in central and eastern Europe and some countries in central Asia, where these declines were larger from 2010 to 2019 than from 2001 to 2010. Change in lung cancer saw a decadal improvement in many countries, especially for males, and many other cancers saw a mix of improvement and deterioration.\n\nINTERPRETATION: From 2010 to 2019, NCD mortality declined in four of every five countries in the world. These improvements were not as large as the preceding decade for most countries, driven by smaller declines in mortality from multiple NCDs.\n\nFUNDING: UK Medical Research Council, UK National Institute for Health and Care Research, and NCD Alliance."
