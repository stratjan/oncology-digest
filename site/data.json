      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The standard treatment for unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is anti-PD-L1 therapy combined with chemoradiotherapy (anti-PD-L1-CRT). Although some patients achieve complete cancer eradication and cure, more than half of patients retain persistent cancer cells. Our research aimed to unravel the nuanced mechanisms involved in both immune attack and evasion induced by anti-PD-L1-CRT with single cell spatial transcriptome.\n\nMETHODS: Xenium is a cutting-edge single-cell spatial analysis tool that enables pathology-based and single-cell analyses while preserving spatial information. In our study, we used Xenium to identify the tumour microenvironment (TME), immune dynamics, and residual cancer cells at the single-cell level following treatment with anti-PD-L1-CRT.\n\nRESULTS: Posttreatment alterations included a significant increase in CXCL9+ cells and CXCL13 + T cells, particularly around tumour cells. Additionally, we discovered that CXCL13 + T cells directly impact cancer cells in the posttreatment environment. Moreover, we identified clusters of immune-cold cancer cells posttreatment, revealing their activation of DNA repair pathways and high proliferative capacity. The novel spatial analysis tool Xenium enabled identification of the immune environment at the single-cell level following treatment with anti-PD-L1-CRT, elucidating its characteristics.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest potential advancements in developing new treatments to improve posttreatment immune responses and address resistance challenges."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 85 % of lung cancers, with five-year survival only 4.5 % for metastatic disease. Programmed death (ligand)-1 (PD-[L]1) inhibitors have advanced NSCLC treatment, but patient demographics can potentially affect clinical outcomes. This systematic literature review and meta-analysis were undertaken to determine if the benefits of anti-PD-(L)1 therapies in NSCLC are independent of race (bio-geographic background).\n\nMETHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and World Health Organization Global Index Medicus were systematically searched (inception-to-Aug-2024). Primary analysis focused on studies with subgroup analysis (White vs Asian, White vs Non-White, Asian vs Non-Asian) of anti-PD-(L)1 efficacy in both resectable/localized and unresectable/advanced NSCLC. Subgroup analysis included stratification by PD-L1 expression, treatment line, and treatment regimen. Bayesian inferential meta-analysis was performed for outcomes with ≥ 1 study.\n\nRESULTS: From 4406 records, 22 randomized controlled trials, 3 pooled analyses, and 2 pharmacokinetic studies were included. In unresectable/advanced NSCLC, anti-PD-(L)1 therapy significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) for White (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80; 95 % credible interval [95 % CrI] 0.74-0.87, p < 0.001 and HR 0.68; 95 % CrI 0.61-0.77, p < 0.001, respectively) and Asian (HR 0.81; 95 % CrI 0.69-0.96, p = 0.027 and HR 0.63; 95 % CrI 0.50-0.80, p = 0.002) patients. The significant improvements in PFS were maintained for both groups within all sub-analyses. Limited data prohibited conduction of meta-analysis for resectable/localized NSCLC.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The benefits of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy in unresectable/advanced NSCLC appear similar for White and Asian patients. Increased quality and quantity of data is required to draw definitive conclusions for resectable/localized NSCLC and with respect to treatment line/regimen and PD-L1 expression."

      "abstract": "At the first interim analysis of the global, randomized, phase 3, double-blind ADRIATIC trial in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) not progressing after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT), consolidation durvalumab significantly improved overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] 0.73) and progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR; HR 0.76) versus placebo (dual primary endpoints). We report an exploratory analysis in patients enrolled in Japan. Patients received durvalumab 1500 mg (N = 264), durvalumab+tremelimumab 75 mg (4 doses, N = 200; arm remained blinded), or placebo (N = 266) every 4 weeks for ≤ 24 months. Prior cCRT ± prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was per local standards of care. In the Japan subgroup, 19 and 31 patients received durvalumab and placebo, respectively; prior cCRT comprised cisplatin-etoposide/carboplatin-etoposide in 94.7/5.3% and 87.1/12.9% and once-daily/twice-daily radiotherapy in 10.5/89.5% and 0/100%; 52.6% and 58.1% received PCI. Median OS was not reached versus 44.9 months (3-year OS 67.4% versus 58.1%; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.24-1.62). Median PFS by BICR was 44.2 versus 29.4 months (24-month PFS 59.6% vs. 58.6%; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.44-2.36); median PFS by investigator assessment (sensitivity analysis) was 44.2 versus 19.7 months (24-month PFS 65.6% vs. 47.0%; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.28-1.51). With durvalumab and placebo, 21.1% and 19.4% had maximum grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs), 21.1% and 9.7% had AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and 52.6% and 45.2% had pneumonitis/radiation pneumonitis (grade 3-4: 0% and 6.5%). In conclusion, consolidation durvalumab demonstrated a favorable risk/benefit profile in Japanese patients with LS-SCLC post cCRT. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03703297."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the performance of two segmentation algorithms for nodule volumetric classification at participant/scan level in the NELCIN-B3 cohort (Netherlands and China Big-3), a lung cancer screening program (LCS) using low-dose CT (LDCT).\n\nMETHODS: Baseline scans with qualified LDCT images from consecutive NELCIN-B3 participants were included from June 2017 to July 2018. Performance of two software algorithms were independently evaluated by two radiologists: software A (Syngo.via VB30A) by reader 1 and software B (AVIEW v1.1.39.14) by reader 2. According to the NELSON2.0 protocol, nodules with a solid component ≥ 100 mm\n\nRESULTS: In total, 300 participants were evaluated comprising 159 women (53.0 %) and 193 (64.3 %) never smokers, with a mean ± standard deviation age of 61.2 ± 7.1 years. There were disagreements in 17 cases: in 11 (11/300, 3.7 %), this was due to differences in nodule selection and nodule type classification between readers; and in 6 (6/300, 2.0 %), this was due to variations in nodule volume metrics between algorithms. Inter-software agreement was almost perfect (κ = 0.88 [95 %CI: 0.83-0.93]). In the consensus read, reader 1/software A generated 12 misclassifications (11 PM, 1 NM), giving a negative predictive value of 99.6 % (95 % CI: 98.9 %-100.0 %). Reader 2/software B generated 5 misclassifications (2 PM, 3 NM), giving a negative predictive value of 98.9 % (95 % CI: 97.7 %-100.0 %).\n\nCONCLUSION: Two software algorithms (Syngo.via VB30A and AVIEW v1.1.39.14) showed comparable performance for lung nodule volumetric classification at participant/scan level. Further research is needed to confirm the results in other LDCT LCS programs."

      "abstract": "Characterizing and validating which mutations influence development of cancer is challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI) has delivered significant advances in protein structure prediction, but its utility for identifying cancer drivers is less explored. We evaluate multiple computational methods for identifying cancer driver mutations. For re-identifying known drivers, methods incorporating protein structure or functional genomic data outperform methods trained only on evolutionary data. We validate variants of unknown significance (VUSs) annotated as pathogenic by testing their association with overall survival in two cohorts of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (N = 7965 and 977). VUSs identified as pathogenic drivers by AI in KEAP1 and SMARCA4 are associated with worse survival, unlike \"benign\" VUSs. \"Pathogenic\" VUSs also exhibit mutual exclusivity with known oncogenic alterations at the pathway level, further suggesting biological validity. AI predictions thus contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of tumor genetics as validated by real-world data."
