      "abstract": "The bispecific antibody tarlatamab recruits T cells to cancers expressing the neuroendocrine epitope DLL3. Tarlatamab is effective in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), but clinical outcomes vary, and no biomarkers enable patient selection. Single-cell RNA sequencing of SCLC biopsies identifies heterogeneity in DLL3 expression, and analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) distinguishes individual patients as predominantly DLL3Pos or DLL3Low. In a prospective cohort of 20 patients, pretreatment DLL3 expression on CTCs predicts tarlatamab clinical benefit (85% sensitivity, 100% specificity). Necrotic CTC clusters in blood accompany treatment-induced tumor lysis. Acquired resistance to tarlatamab is associated in some cases with loss of DLL3 expression, but persistence of other targetable neuro-endocrine epitopes; in other patients, DLL3 is retained on CTCs, but accompanied by systemic markers of T cell dysfunction. Quantitation of DLL3-positive CTCs identifies patients likely to benefit from tarlatamab, and longitudinal monitoring may guide therapeutic decision-making at the time of acquired resistance."

      "abstract": "Anti-PD1 therapy benefits a subset of brain metastasis (BrM) patients; however, heterogeneous responses imply an incomplete understanding of the brain-immune ecosystem. To elucidate host-driven determinants of this variability, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the brain microenvironment. While anti-PD1 induced robust anti-tumor immune activation, it uniquely, among all ICIs tested, compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. This permeabilization was mediated by DKK1-expressing activated CD8⁺ T cells through the induction of β-catenin/TCF and FOXM1 pathways, contributing to endothelial cell destabilization. Depleting plasma-DKK1 restored BBB integrity and reduced experimental BrM formation. Clinically, lung cancer patients receiving anti-PD1 exhibited increased MRI contrast enhancement in the brain, suggestive of BBB perturbations, and increasing plasma DKK1 levels correlated with higher BrM incidence in non-responders. Sequencing anti-PD1 followed by cisplatin improved intracranial cisplatin delivery and therapeutic efficacy in ICI-resistant BrM. These findings identify anti-PD1-induced BBB modulation as a tractable vulnerability in BrM management."

      "abstract": "Patients diagnosed with fibrosing interstitial lung disease are at risk of several complications, some of which may be life-threatening. Computed tomography imaging plays an important role in diagnosing these overlapping conditions. This article summarizes the computed tomography imaging features of the most common conditions associated with fibrosing interstitial lung diseases, categorized by involvement of the lung parenchyma or extra-pulmonary compartments. Some steps may help to recognize such complications, such as having knowledge of the underlying fibrotic lung disease, being aware of potentially immunosuppressive treatments in use, noting new relevant symptoms, checking previous imaging examinations to detect subtle changes, and considering the exam technique, for example, to avoid false perception of ground-glass opacities in exams with insufficient inspiration. Unenhanced computed tomography may be enough to diagnose most situations, but in specific cases, for example, in the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism, dedicated computed tomography angiography may be warranted. Careful comparison with previous exams is advised, especially to detect subtle opacities suspicious for lung cancer, underscoring that its detection may be difficult owing to the baseline morphological lung changes. Radiologists must be aware of such possible complications to perform early diagnosis and ensure proper management."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common histological subtype of lung cancer with high metastatic propensity. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role in tumor metastasis, but the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. This study investigates the role of RIPK2 in EMT and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nMETHODS: TCGA database analysis determined RIPK2 expression and clinical significance. RNA interference, overexpression, qRT-PCR, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence were employed in A549 and PC-9 cell lines. Transwell, EdU, colony formation assays, and cytoskeletal staining assessed cell invasion, proliferation, and EMT changes. Nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) fusion proteins investigated subcellular localization effects. Tail vein injection in nude mice validated in vivo effects.\n\nRESULTS: RIPK2 was highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and associated with poor prognosis. RIPK2 knockdown inhibited while overexpression promoted EMT, invasion, and metastasis. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confirmed direct RIPK2-STAT3 interaction. RIPK2 specifically upregulated EMT transcription factor SNAIL expression. Co-expression of RIPK2 and SNAIL correlated with shorter patient survival. STAT3 or SNAIL knockdown inhibited RIPK2-induced EMT and metastasis. Nuclear-localized RIPK2 completely restored cellular EMT, invasion, and metastatic capabilities while enhancing cisplatin resistance.\n\nCONCLUSION: RIPK2 translocates to the nucleus, interacts with STAT3, and synergistically upregulates SNAIL expression, promoting EMT, invasion, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. The RIPK2-STAT3-SNAIL signaling axis represents a potential therapeutic target."

NEOpredict-Lung (NCT04205552) established the feasibility of dual blockade of PD-1 and LAG-3 immune checkpoints prior to curatively intended resection. Here we report extended follow-up, postoperative treatments and patterns of response and recurrence.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with resectable NSCLC (stages IB-IIIA) were randomized to receive two doses nivolumab (240 mg, arm A) with or without relatlimab (80 mg, arm B) every 2 weeks. Overall and disease-free survival (OS, DFS) rates, response and recurrence patterns and subsequent therapies were evaluated.\n\nRESULTS: 60 patients were enrolled from March 2020 to July 2022. The present analysis was conducted per December 2024 with a median follow-up of 37.4 months. 45 patients were alive without disease recurrence,15 patients recurred (4 locoregional and 11 metastatic), and 7 patients died. The 3-year OS and DFS rates were 88.4 % and 73.3 % in arm A and 88.9 % and 60.3 % in arm B. Patients achieving major pathological response (≤10 % viable tumor cells in resected NSCLC) trended towards better DFS (HR 0.35; 95 % CI, 0.1-1.19). Downstaging was confirmed in 53.3 % of patients in arm A and in 66.7 % of patients in arm B. Nodal downstaging occurred in 28.6 % of patients with nodal disease in arm A and in 66.7 % of patients in arm B.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Short course preoperative nivolumab with or without relatlimab showed encouraging efficacy and survival outcomes, which compare favorably with chemo-immunotherapy-based perioperative treatment regimens."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unless greater awareness inspires action, lung cancer will become the next global public health emergency. Despite improvements in screening, diagnosis, and treatments, more must be done because global incidence continues to increase. Concerted action must address the burden both between and within countries. Inequalities result from the uneven distribution of resources while inequities result from differences in prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\nMETHOD: Participants in the 9th International Lung Cancer Network conference (Athens, June 2023) received an advanced draft of the declaration with a confidentiality notice by email upon completion of online registration. They were invited to provide comments and suggestions up to seven days before the meeting. All contributions were reviewed by the authors and incorporated into the final version circulated the day before the meeting began. Although not a formal Delphi-style process, this approach prioritized inclusivity, transparency, and broad endorsement. Outreach extended beyond onsite attendees, ensuring diverse perspectives and representation. This process complements methodological consensus approaches by uniting stakeholders around shared policy goals.\n\nRESULTS: At the 9th International Lung Cancer Network conference, participants were invited to sign the final declaration, and 785 did so. Since then, 20 organizations worldwide have formally endorsed the Consensus Statement, and support continues to grow. The inclusive design has fostered broad and sustained backing, underscoring the value of the Statement as a unifying policy declaration advancing shared principles.\n\nCONCLUSION: The Consensus Statement, Bridging the Gap in the Diagnosis and Management of Lung Cancer, reinforces five unifying principles: improve and expand prevention; focus on early detection; ensure equitable and sustainable access to treatment; build partnerships and promote investment; and, combat stigma, recognizing it as a social determinant of public health."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: NRG Oncology/Alliance LU005 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03811002) tested the addition of atezolizumab to concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) in this open-label, phase III international trial.\n\nMETHODS: Patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC), stage Tx-IV, N0-3, and M0 with Eastern Cooperative Group performance status (PS) 0-2 received one cycle of chemotherapy (platinum/etoposide) before study registration and were randomly assigned to CRT alone versus CRT plus concurrent and adjuvant atezolizumab, 1,200 mg once daily, every 3 weeks until investigator-assessed progression or intolerable side effects for a maximum of 17 cycles. Patients were stratified by choice of chemotherapy (cisplatin\n\nRESULTS: patients were randomly assigned from May 2019 to December 2023. The median OS was 36.1 months (95% CI, 28.1 to 42.5) for the CRT-alone arm and 31.1 months (95% CI, 28.5 to 44.7) for the CRT + atezolizumab arm, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03 [95% CI, 0.80 to 1.32]). The median PFS was 11.4 months (95% CI, 10.3 to 13.2) for the CRT-alone arm and 12.1 months (95% CI, 10.9 to 15.2) for the CRT + atezolizumab arm, respectively (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.22]). The median DMFS was 13.0 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 18.2) for the CRT-alone arm and 16.8 months (95% CI, 12.1 to 21.6) for the CRT + atezolizumab arm (HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.21]). No unexpected safety signals with concurrent atezolizumab were observed.\n\nCONCLUSION: Concurrent and adjuvant atezolizumab with chemoradiation did not improve survival in patients with LS-SCLC."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Clinical guidelines recommend upfront osimertinib monotherapy for asymptomatic brain metastases (BM) in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), despite a lack of randomised trial evidence. We conducted two randomised phase II trials, OUTRUN and LUOSICNS, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upfront stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) plus osimertinib versus osimertinib in this patient population.\n\nMETHODS: Participants with up to ten BM amenable to SRS were randomised 1:1 to SRS followed by osimertinib (80mg daily) or osimertinib monotherapy. SRS was delivered as a single or multi-fraction regimen. The primary endpoint was 12-month intracranial progression-free survival (ic-PFS). Key secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), patterns of intracranial progression, and safety. Data from both trials were prospectively pooled for a joint analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Overall, 79 participants were randomised. At a median follow-up of 39.0 months, 12-month ic-PFS was not significantly different between SRS plus osimertinib (n = 39) over osimertinib monotherapy (n = 40) (11%, 95% CI, -10% to 32%, P=.31; median ic-PFS 21.9 versus 17.2 months). Median OS was 46.1 versus 29.1 months. Among those with intracranial progression, 35% in the SRS plus osimertinib group and 57% in the osimertinib monotherapy group underwent SRS at progression. Grade 3/4 radionecrosis occurred in 5% of participants treated with SRS plus osimertinib.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Adding upfront SRS to osimertinib did not significantly improve 12-month ic-PFS in EGFR mutant NSCLC with BM. This represents the first randomised evidence supporting the use of osimertinib monotherapy as upfront therapy in minimally symptomatic patients with low burden BM."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The cardiovascular toxicity of radiation therapy (RT) remains incompletely understood in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our objective was to define changes in echocardiographic parameters of structure and function with RT and their associations with cardiac dose-volume metrics.\n\nMETHODS: This multi-center, longitudinal prospective cohort study included participants with NSCLC who received standard, curative-intent thoracic RT. Dose-volume metrics were extracted from centrally contoured cardiac substructures. Echocardiograms at baseline, end of RT, six months post-RT, and 12 months post-RT were core lab-quantified. Repeated-measures multivariable linear regression via generalized estimating equations estimated changes in echocardiographic measures and associations with dose-volume metrics.\n\nRESULTS: Across 125 participants, there was a modest worsening in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p=0.019), global longitudinal strain (p<0.001), circumferential strain (p<0.001), and Ea/Ees (p=0.011) post-RT that largely recovered by 12 months. Cardiac dysfunction, defined as LVEF declines of ≥10% to <50%, occurred in 7.2% of participants at a median of 1.7 months after RT initiation. Mean heart dose (MHD) was associated with LVEF declines (-1.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-2.2,0.0] per interquartile range (IQR) increase, p=0.044), as was whole heart V30 (-1.4%, 95%CI[-2.5,-0.3] per IQR increase, p=0.015); with multiple comparisons adjustment, whole heart V30 remained significant (p=0.030).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: On average, there were modest changes in cardiac function immediately after RT in patients with NSCLC, with a subset experiencing clinically relevant cardiac dysfunction. While whole heart V30 was associated with LVEF declines, suggesting its relevance in RT planning, there is also a need for newer dose-volume measures."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and extrapulmonary neuroendocrine (NE) tumors are aggressive malignancies with limited treatment options. Seizure-related homolog 6 (SEZ6) is a potential therapeutic target, but its expression in these tumors remains poorly understood. Lineage plasticity contributes to resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where some cases can undergo SCLC-transformation after targeted therapy. We aimed to characterize SEZ6 expression across NE tumors and presumed NSCLC-to-SCLC transformations.\n\nMETHODS: DNA and RNA sequencing were performed for SCLC, NSCLC, and NE samples. Samples were stratified by SEZ6 RNA expression quartiles and classified into subtypes based on ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 expression. Significance was tested using the Mann-Whitney U test. Real-world overall survival was obtained from insurance claims data, with p-values calculated using the log-rank test. Paired samples for NSCLC-to-SCLC transformation were identified by sequential biopsies classified as NSCLC followed by SCLC.\n\nRESULTS: RNA sequencing was performed on 1318 SCLC and 2218 NE samples. Median SEZ6expression was higher in SCLC (39.7 transcripts per million (TPM)) than in NE tumors (20.8 TPM, p<0.0001) and NSCLC (1.34 TPM, p<0.001). Among NE tumors, median SEZ6 expression was highest in prostate (52.0 TPM, p=0.0016 vs SCLC) and lowest in adrenal gland tumors (1.2 TPM, p<0.0001 vs SCLC). In SCLC,SEZ6expression was positively correlated with ASCL1(p=0.44, p<0.0001) andNEUROD1(p=0.16, p<0.0001) expression but notPOU2F3(p=-0.04, p=0.1253). Median survival was longest in SEZ6-Q2 for both SCLC and NE (13.0 mos. and 33.7 mos., respectively). NSCLC-to-SCLC transformation samples showed numerically higher SEZ6 expression post-transformation (median: 86.2 vs 2.4 TPM).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: SEZ6expression is higher in SCLC than in NE tumors, with notable heterogeneity by subtype, warranting consideration of expanded use of SEZ6-directed therapy. Translational Relevance Statement: This study establishes SEZ6 as a promising therapeutic target in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and transformed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), demonstrating its significantly elevated expression compared to neuroendocrine (NE) tumors and NSCLC. The positive correlation of SEZ6 expression with NE lineage markers, particularly in ASCL1 and NEUROD1 subtypes, highlights its role as a lineage-specific marker, guiding the development of SEZ6-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Additionally, the increased SEZ6 expression following NSCLC-to-SCLC transformation suggests that SEZ6-targeted therapies could address resistance mechanisms in transformed tumors. Importantly, the association between high SEZ6 expression and shorter survival indicates that integrating SEZ6 status into diagnostic workflows could help stratify patients by risk and guide therapeutic decision-making. The findings from this study will inform future clinical trials, aiming to implement SEZ6-targeted treatments as part of precision oncology strategies for aggressive NE malignancies."
