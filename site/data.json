      "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence have highlighted the transcriptional regulatory activity of H3.3 at promoters and telomeres. However, H3.3 may also play transcriptional regulation-independent roles. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of H3F3A, the gene encoding H3.3, supported the pathogenesis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) by protecting PARP1 from degradation. Chromatin-associated H3.3 and PARP1 physically interacted, which required the 645-662 amino acid domain of PARP1 and the 20-60 amino acid region of H3.3. Notably, the H3.3-PARP1 interaction blocked K48-linked polyubiquitination of PARP1 at K654 and H3.3 at K36, establishing a positive feedback loop that prevented ubiquitin-mediated degradation of both proteins. Functionally, the oncogenic potential of H3.3 and its role in maintaining genomic stability in SCLC could be partially attributed to the H3.3-PARP1 interaction and the subsequent accumulation of PARP1, which preserved DNA damage repair capacity. Overall, these findings uncover a reciprocal stabilization mechanism between PARP1 and H3.3 within the chromatin context that drives SCLC progression, providing valuable insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms driving this malignancy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Trials of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (chemoIO) have changed the standard of care for resectable nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study characterizes the outcomes of off-trial patients who received treatment with neoadjuvant chemoIO.\n\nMETHODS: The authors analyzed records of patients with stage IB-III NSCLC who received neoadjuvant chemoIO with an intent to proceed to surgical resection at three US academic institutions. Clinical, demographic, and pathologic factors were incorporated in univariable and multivariable regression models to identify associations with outcomes (resection status, pathologic complete response [pCR], and subsequent event-free survival [EFS]) after standard-of-care neoadjuvant chemoIO.\n\nRESULTS: Analyses included 115 patients, of whom 63% had stage III disease, 77% completed three cycles of chemoIO, and 78% underwent surgical resection. Ages older than 72 years versus 64 years and younger were associated with not proceeding to surgery in univariable (p = .006) and multivariable (p = .014) regression analyses. Nineteen patients (17%) had tumors with a pCR, and 34 (30%) had a major pathologic response. Positive programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (≥50%; vs. negative PD-L1 expression: odds ratio, 12.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-73.7; p = .007) and KRAS mutations (vs. wild-type KRAS: odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-14.4; p = .039) were associated with a higher probability of pCR in univariable analysis. The median event-free survival was not reached and did not differ among subgroups stratified by key clinical variables.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The results from this study confirm the trial experience of high pCR rates after neoadjuvant chemoIO. This supports the use of chemoIO irrespective of KRAS mutation status, PD-L1 expression, and histology, but suggests that this approach may be less suitable for older patients."

This exploratory analysis focused on patients with tumor cell programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression ≥ 50%.\n\nMETHODS: Patients with stage IIIB/IV nsq-NSCLC were randomized (2:1) to tislelizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy and pemetrexed every 3 weeks, followed by maintenance tislelizumab and pemetrexed, or platinum-based chemotherapy and pemetrexed followed by maintenance pemetrexed. The primary endpoint was independent review committee (IRC)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), IRC-assessed objective response rates, and safety.\n\nRESULTS: The PD-L1 ≥ 50% population included 110 patients (tislelizumab plus chemotherapy, n = 74; chemotherapy, n = 36); 71.8% (n = 79) were male and 28.2% (n = 31) were female. Consistent with the final analysis (median follow-up 16.5 months), the 4-year follow-up data (median follow-up 23.4 months) continued to show an improvement in median PFS (17.2 vs. 4.6 months; stratified HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.17-0.50) and median OS (41.9 vs. 13.1 months; stratified HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23-0.62) for patients who received tislelizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy. An additional post hoc analysis showed no significant differences in PFS or OS between PD-L1 50-89% and ≥ 90% subgroups in the tislelizumab plus chemotherapy arm. The safety profile of tislelizumab plus chemotherapy was manageable and consistent with previous analyses.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced nsq-NSCLC and PD-L1 tumor cell expression ≥ 50%, first-line tislelizumab plus chemotherapy demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and OS versus chemotherapy. Efficacy was consistent across subgroups of patients with high PD-L1 tumor cell expression levels (50-89% and ≥ 90%).\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov NCT03663205."

Performance of two software algorithms were independently evaluated by two radiologists: software A (Syngo.via VB30A) by reader 1 and software B (AVIEW v1.1.39.14) by reader 2.

There were disagreements in 17 cases: in 11 (11/300, 3.7 %), this was due to differences in nodule selection and nodule type classification between readers; and in 6 (6/300, 2.0 %), this was due to variations in nodule volume metrics between algorithms. Inter-software agreement was almost perfect (κ = 0.88 [95 %CI: 0.83-0.93]). In the consensus read, reader 1/software A generated 12 misclassifications (11 PM, 1 NM), giving a negative predictive value of 99.6 % (95 % CI: 98.9 %-100.0 %). Reader 2/software B generated 5 misclassifications (2 PM, 3 NM), giving a negative predictive value of 98.9 % (95 % CI: 97.7 %-100.0 %).\n\nCONCLUSION: Two software algorithms (Syngo.via VB30A and AVIEW v1.1.39.14) showed comparable performance for lung nodule volumetric classification at participant/scan level.

      "abstract": "Although the involvement of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) in metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis has been previously described, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, the starting material for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In a companion study by Zhang et al., we demonstrated that PLK1 phosphorylation of PDHA1 at threonine 57 (PDHA1-T57) drives its protein degradation via mitophagy activation. Using a stable-isotope resolved metabolomics (SIRM) approach, we now show that PLK1 phosphorylation of PDHA1-T57 results in metabolic reprogramming from OXPHOS to glycolysis. Notably, cells mimicking PDHA1-T57 phosphorylation rely more on the aspartate-malate shuttle than on glucose-derived pyruvate to sustain the TCA cycle. This metabolic shift was also observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and transgenic mice conditionally expressing the PDHA1-T57D variant, highlighting the role of PLK1 in metabolic reprogramming in vivo. It is well-established that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-mediated phosphorylation of PDH leads to its inactivation and that dichloroacetic acid (DCA), a PDK inhibitor, has been investigated in preclinical and early clinical studies as a potential therapeutic agent for lung cancer. We demonstrated that DCA combined with Onvansertib, a PLK1 inhibitor, synergistically inhibits lung tumor growth by enhancing mitochondrial ROS, inhibiting glycolysis, and inducing apoptosis. This study aims to elucidate how PLK1-associated activity drives the metabolic reprogramming from OXPHOS to glycolysis during cellular transformation, thereby contributing to lung carcinogenesis. Our results provide support for a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of Onvansertib plus DCA in treating lung cancer."

We undertook a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, of abstracts and posters from annual meetings of American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) up until November 2024.\n\nEXPERT OPINION: We believe that in the near future ICI plus chemotherapy combinations will represent the new recommended standard of care in the neoadjuvant/perioperative setting.

An algorithm to identify patients at high risk for RP may help clinicians mitigate risk.\n\nMETHODS: All LA-NSCLC patients treated with definitive radiotherapy at our institution from 2006 to 2021 were retrospectively assessed. A convolutional neural network was previously developed to identify patients with radiographic ILD using planning computed tomography (CT) images. All screen-positive (AI-ILD + ) patients were reviewed by a thoracic radiologist to identify true radiographic ILD (r-ILD). The association between the algorithm output, clinical and dosimetric variables, and the outcomes of grade ≥ 3 RP and mortality were assessed using univariate (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.\n\nRESULTS: 698 patients were included in the analysis. Grade (G) 0-5 RP was reported in 51 %, 27 %, 17 %, 4.4 %, 0.14 % and 0.57 % of patients, respectively. Overall, 23 % of patients were classified as AI-ILD + . On MVA, only AI-ILD status (OR 2.15, p = 0.03) and AI-ILD score (OR 35.27, p < 0.01) were significant predictors of G3 + RP. Median OS was 3.6 years in AI-ILD- patients and 2.3 years in AI-ILD + patients (NS). Patients with r-ILD had significantly higher rates of severe toxicities, with G3 + RP 25 % and G5 RP 7 %. R-ILD was associated with an increased risk for G3 + RP on MVA (OR 5.42, p < 0.01).\n\nCONCLUSION: Our AI-ILD algorithm detects patients with significantly increased risk for G3 + RP."

      "abstract": "Oncogenic KRAS mutations are frequently detected in NSCLC. It remains a major challenge to target all KRAS mutants. MEK inhibitors are considered candidates for treating KRAS-mutant NSCLC; however, their easy adaptive resistance precludes further application. Here, we found that MEK inhibitor-trametinib treatment results in the feedback activation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and that treatment with the pan-RTK inhibitor anlotinib effectively inhibits the progression of KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Furthermore, we evaluated this strategy in a clinical study (NCT04967079) involving 33 advanced non-G12C KRAS-mutant NSCLC patients. The phase Ia containing 13 patients showed that the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is trametinib (2 mg) plus anlotinib (8 mg), the objective response rate (ORR) is 69.2% (95% CI: 38.6-90.9), the median progression-free survival (PFS) is 6.9 months (95% CI: 3.9 to could not be evaluated), disease control rate (DCR) is 92% (95% CI: 64.0-99.8) and the rate of adverse events (AEs) ≥grade 3 is 23%. The phase Ib containing 20 patients demonstrated the high efficacy of this combinational therapy with RP2D, with the ORR at 65% (95% CI: 40.8-84.6), the median PFS is 11.5 months (95% CI: 8.3-15.5), the median overall survival (OS) is 15.5 months (95% CI: 15.5 to could not be evaluated), the DCR at 100% (95% CI: 83.2-100.0), the median duration of overall response (DoR) is 9.3 months (95% CI: 2.5-12.1), and the rate of AEs ≥ grade 3 at 35%. Overall, this study provides a potential combinational therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutant NSCLC through the cotargeting of MEK and RTKs."
